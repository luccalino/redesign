                <p style="text-align:left;">September 4/5, 2020</p>  
                <p style="text-align:left;" class="text-center">Farming is one of the oldest professions. Due to the extensive development of information technology, agriculture is facing yet another significant change after the industrial revolution. For farmers, there is a myriad of challenges to cope with, yet also as many opportunities. This premise was the point of reference for the first Swiss farming hackathon in 2020, called <a href="https://opendata.ch/projects/open-farming-hackdays-2020/" target="_blank">Open Farming Hackdays</a>.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;" class="text-center">Much hope lies in data-driven analyses. Data is valuable as everyone knows. As the wisdom goes, the more the data, the better. In many areas, however, there is no systematic data available. Thus, the main challenge is to collect data first before harvesting it for new insights. Unfortunately, much data is proprietary, meaning not free to use for everyone interested in it. Only open data enables innovation as any actors can make use of it by developing a multitude of solutions.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;" class="text-center">In farming, crowdsourced data about the spread of plant diseases or neophytes' prevalence could broadly foster new sustainable practices in the longer term. Against this backdrop, we developed an end-to-end prototype featuring the following:
                <ul>
                  <li style="text-align:left;">a <b>mobile web application</b> to record geo-referenced data on the field</li>
                  <li style="text-align:left;">a <b>cloud-based web service</b> to aggregate the data at a central place</li>
                  <li style="text-align:left;">a Python script to <b>access, combine, and plot this data with any other data source</b> of interest</li>
                </ul>  
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:left;">June 21, 2019</p>  
                <p style="text-align:left;" class="text-center">Restaurant visitors have a critical tongue. The degree of criticism, however, depends on the expectations that visitors have for a gastronomic experience. This means, expectations are an increasing function of the restaurant's price category. This paper argues that restaurant reviewers tend to "show off" their culinary capital in written restaurant reviews for the most prestigious establishments, i.e. fine dining, but take a moderate approach when reviewing commonplace restaurants. Review texts are more extensive for fine dining establishments as compared to mid range restaurants or cheap eats. Fine dining reviewers are more negative in their written review text at both ends of the numerical review scale, i.e. for terrible and excellent experiences. Word clustering increases and linguistic diversity decreases with the restaurant's price category. Central elements in excellent reviews of fine dining establishments are the interplay between food and wine, the food itself in mid range restaurants and quality/price considerations in cheap eats.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left;">May 3, 2019</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;" class="text-center">Beef meat consumption is high in Switzerland and has been growing in the last years. International trade has contributed to this unfavourable trend. A high beef consumption is having severe adverse effects on human and planetary health. This paper argues that the price of beef needs to be increased through import tariffs on beef imports and taxation on domestically produced beef. Only a higher price of beef will more likely trigger a shift to animal-based proteins. Direct consumption of animal-based proteins needs to be advertised and incentivised and technological advancements that aim at producing alternative meat forms should be subsidised.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align:left;" class="section-heading">Food planning and obesity</h3>
                <p style="text-align:left;">February 19, 2019</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;" class="text-center">The share of obese individuals in the US has reached an alarming level. In 2016, one out of three was classified as obese. The emerging dominance of large supermarket chains with extensive product selections and targeted selling strategies has played an indispensable role. The aim of this paper is therefore to elaborate on the relationship between food planning, measured by the frequency of shopping list use and assumed to alleviate impulsive buying, and obesity. At question is whether individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds are equally affected. The paper finds for a representative US sample of 15,661 individuals that members from households with household income below the poverty guidelines ("Poor") who never shop with a grocery list are 11.5% more likely to be obese as compared to poor individuals who almost always shop with a list. No relationship between food planning and obesity is found for individuals from low- or high-income households. However, the paper argues that food planning should be incentivised regardless of socioeconomic status. Through food planning, poor households should be rewarded with a bonus that is additional to financial assistance in food acquisitions and wealthier households should be reminded in times of abundance of the necessity of acquisitions.</p>
