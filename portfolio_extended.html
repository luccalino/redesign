                <h3 class="section-heading">Food planning and obesity</h3>
                <p class="text-center">The share of obese individuals in the US has reached an alarming level. In 2016, one out of three was classified as obese. The emerging dominance of large supermarket chains with extensive product selections and targeted selling strategies has played an indispensable role. The aim of this paper is therefore to elaborate on the relationship between food planning, measured by the frequency of shopping list use and assumed to alleviate impulsive buying, and obesity. At question is whether individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds are equally affected. The paper finds for a representative US sample of 15,661 individuals that members from households with household income below the poverty guidelines ("Poor") who never shop with a grocery list are 11.5% more likely to be obese as compared to poor individuals who almost always shop with a list. No relationship between food planning and obesity is found for individuals from low- or high-income households. However, the paper argues that food planning should be incentivised regardless of socioeconomic status. Through food planning, poor households should be rewarded with a bonus that is additional to financial assistance in food acquisitions and wealthier households should be reminded in times of abundance of the necessity of acquisitions.</p>
