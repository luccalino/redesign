"RosieM1114","We had the veggie pizza and the white veggie pizza. Both were absolutely delicious!! Ingredients were so tasty and base was perfect and crispy. Well priced for Copenhagen and good size for one each. Guy serving us was extremely friendly and we enjoyed having a chat. Would highly recommend for a casual dinner. Inside also had a great view of a nearby church.","50"
"Jen T","The service here was super friendly and quick. I ordered the white pizza and it was great. The location is small and at lunch time was very crowded and the chef kept banging something that would make a loud noise in the small space and made it a bit unpleasant. That’s the only reason for 4 instead of 5.","40"
"AndrewH698","Lovely pizza and fabulous friendly service. Made with care and pride and it shows in the results. Recommended for a takeaway or sit in the small restaurant. Very cheap too. Would be good value at twice the price. Wondered from the outside if it was just a small takeaway with fabulous critical mass reviews but I'm very glad I went in.","50"

Both was really great even we asked the club sandwich without sauce because my gf is lactose intolerant. The guy was really kind and helpful.","50"

"AlanT113","After a busy day we were looking for a quick but tasty pizza close by our hotel. We were delighted to find Madbaren. We shared two pizzas - a Veggie and a Club. Fresh and delicious. The combination of ingredients was spot on. The person making the pizza was friendly and helpful. We arrived close to closing but he didn’t make us feel rushed or a nuisance. The price was very reasonable. Can recommend very highly!","40"
"ADC_10","We arrived stressed out with our arguing children and within seconds were charmed by this lovely cafe. Pizzas were delicious and the owner very thoughtfully asked how the children liked their pizza. We ordered salads, absolutely delicious and filling as they were served with toasted bread. Would recommend and visit again. Such a nice place to stop and transformed our day. Great coffee too!","50"
"LauzFaye","My family and I (with three young children) visited yesterday. The chef was incredibly welcoming and friendly, the food was great and the chef even made a new sandwich for our five year old who suddenly decided he didn’t like lettuce halfway through his sandwich (kids!). Would definitely recommend.","50"
