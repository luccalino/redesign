"tcuts11","My husband and I are traveling and decided on this restaurant for my special birthday dinner during our vacation and I’m so glad we did! Not only was the food AMAZING, the two men who own the restaurant also are the chefs and waiters. They explain how all the dishes are made in detail and are very accommodating with requests (I’m pregnant so need to adjust my diet slightly right now). They chat with you and make you feel like you are having dinner amongst friends. With only 30 seats in the restaurant the atmosphere is cozy almost as if you were eating in an apartment. If you’re looking for simply just a wonderful meal and easy evening, definitely add this restaurant to your list! 10/10 would recommend.","50"

"jamespL1374UX","On our final day to Copenhagen my girlfriend and I went to this wonderful restaurant based on fellow travellers feedback and I must say this has been one of my favourite culinary experiences ever.   Upon entering you are greeted by the staff like an old friend which makes you feel at home .   The decour is fantastic while there is a lovely warm ambience .   The food was on a different level . We opted for the taster menu and it was simply devine .   The starter consisted of aubergine and tomato topped with parmesan which was fantastic .   The soup was a mussel , sun dried tomato broth with capers which also had cream through it . Every mouthful brought a different but enjoyable taste .   The first mains taster was a grilled tuna with salsa verde and gnocchi . This dish was simply sensational .   The second taster was occo buco which is a beef dish off the shin . It was simply sensational along the accompiments .   We somehow had room for dessert so opted for the cannoli filled with cherry , orange and cream which was splendid . My girlfriend went for petit fours which were gorgeous .   This is definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and deserves all the accolades given so if you are going to take a trip to this magical city then do book this place and make it even more special","50"
"Louise H","Picked it purely based on reviews on Trip. Was not disappointed at all. Quality of food absolutely first class. Up there with some of my best dining experiences ever. Atmosphere was fun but classy. Very surprised at total cost too. Very pleasantly surprised in fact - compared to what an equivalent meal would have cost in Dubai, it was a bargain! Thoroughly recommend it. Wonderful experience. Thanks guys!","50"
"Akeemthedream78","Wife and I did the tasting menu and wine pairing. Every dish we had was sublime besides the desert(cannoli). The service was spectacular as well. I read other reviews, and before going I was worried that I would hear my server’s life story. Not the case at all. Wines were perfect as well. It cost us about 250 American dollars but considering we are in Copenhagen the price seemed reasonable. If you go I would skip desert and order one additional course. Glad I went and would recommend to others.","50"
"Rossawan P","We had the 7 dish taster menu. I gave the first dish 10/10 but the dishes just got better and better we ran out of numbers to rate the rest. The portion was also perfect. Amazing time we had there.","50"
"Matthew K","I can't recommend this place highly enough. I think this was probably the best overall food experience my wife and I have ever had. Whilst its not cheap, nothing in Copenhagen is, and I really felt it was value for money.   The soup.....oh the soup...i think it needs a new name as soup does not do it justice!  You have got to go for the taster menu and the recommended wines to go with it. Finish off with the cheeseboard which my wife did. I will regret not having it.... probably for the rest of my life!   If i had some advice for future punters it would be let the guys lead you in what to eat and drink. Also, give them back their banter as they love it!. They did not believe me that the cat made me typo my own name...and we fought about it all night long! Right up my street!  Thanks guys, for giving us the best possible food and wine. And the best possible introduction to Copenhagen which my wife and I have fallen in love with.   It turned out to be a fantastic long weekend ....and the bloody cat did stand on the keyboard when I was typing.....oh no, here she is ag9iiji00iju9jhn90y89y ;-)","50"
"FoliesCheres","I had fine dining all over Europe (France, Spain, Italy) and this one of my most memorable meals! We had a 7 course meal with generous wine pairing for 100 euros/person, worthed every penny considering the high quality of food and wine. A meal like that would cost at least $500 pp. here in USA. If you go to Copenhagen this is the best!!!","50"

"Stereotipa","My husband and I went to Restaurant Krebsegaarden on our last day in the city. The experience was just what we were looking for to close our nice trip to Denmark. The owners of the place were hands-on things, so the attention was very personalized. The atmosphere was rather romantique and quaint. The food was extremely delicious. I usually dont enjoy lamb, but their lamb was exceptional for me. Highly recommended!","50"

"thegrahams2001","Before heading to Copenhagen I had carried out some research and decided to book this restaurant based on previous comments made on TripAdvisor. I am so glad I did, and I am also so glad I made my reservation about 5 weeks earlier. I was un sure of exactly what to expect as there was very little in the way of comments on dress code or type of establishment. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed and at that point I just hoped I had confirmed our booking. We were met by Mats, the head chef and he quickly showed us to our table. Our table was up one very small step (watch out for the same step) at the rear of the restaurant. Instantly we were made to feel welcome and any apprehension I had disappeared. Mats took time to explain the options available to us and explained how each option worked. We decided on the sample menu going for 5 courses with wine pairings. Before we even started the food, the bread arrived, a dark rye and honey bread. Absolutely stunning, so we were careful not to fill up on bread before the food arrived. The first course was a langoustine salad. The salad had around 12 ingredients within, cornichons, celery, boiled egg, carrots, bell pepper, dill, bitterness, grapefruit, red onion and I am sure I am missing some. The langoustines were so fresh and along with the salad the taste combinations were amazing. This dish was paired with a lovely dry white wine, perfect. Next was the seabass with a beurre blanc sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked, lovely crisp skin and moist flesh.  Next up was the beer marinated pork cheeks. The pork had been marinated for a couple of days then served with a rich jus, pickled onions and a puree. The pork just fell apart when your fork touched it. Everything on the plate belonged there, the combinations of flavours were amazing again. This dish was paired with an Austrian red wine, stunning. Next up was a stuffed veal fillet with parmesan crisp, veal reduction and gratin potatoes. The veal was cooked perfectly and the depth in the sauce was wonderful.  When the dishes arrived either Mats or a member of staff took time to explain the dish fully and also explain the rational for the pairing with a specific wine. We took a break after this to savour what had gone before. At no point did we feel rushed, the whole evening was enjoyed at a very relaxing and leisurely pace. Finally, we created some space for dessert. We opted for one of each, classic crème caramel and a white chocolate mousse. Both desserts were stunning and the perfect way to finish the meal however the highlight here was the wine. Mats recommended Trockenbeerenauslese, this is a full-bodied dessert wine. AMAZING. The whole evening was simply outstanding, the food, the service, the atmosphere and the surroundings. I am so glad I decided to book this restaurant and thank you other TripAdvisor users for writing your comments.  Mats is an amazing chef but his skills as are a host are pretty amazing too. Thank you, Carsten Marietta and Mats, for a wonderful evening, we will be back. ","50"

"IngvilT","The food and the two Norwegian chefs that run the restaurant is a must in Copenhagen. They change the menu every month and each dish overgoes even a three star Michelin. Delightful tastes with a twist. We recommend the 4 to 5 meal with a winepacket. We were lucky to get a table due to cancellation. So book many months in advice, if not, call the same day to hear if there is cancellations. A food experience you will remember for a long time!","50"
"wilhelmm-norway","Krebsegaarden is located in an old house in the middle of the old city of Copenhagen. The narrow cobble stone streets and houses take you back to the Old Europe, Entering the restaurant, you are warmly welcomed by one of the owners, and the stage is set: This is a very personal restaurant, With few tables, and owners dedicated to creating a memorable dining experience for its guests - and they do it with passion! This is not a New Nordic restaurant, but rather a selection of classic Nordic tastes with a French twist: Wonderful for the taste buds, a real meal in total, and not the frills and froth of the modern Nordic resturants. In addition, the wine selection is excellent; and, the owners are very apt at chosing great wines from a bit out-of-the ordinary regions. Ask them to compose a selection of wines to emphasize Your dining experience, and you will be surprised at how well they do it! This is Our 3rd visit in a year, and standards are as high as ever, although menus frequently change with season and availabilities.This is equally good for a private romantic dinner as for a business occassion - I have been there for both, and will definitely be back! If you are a party of 6-8 guests: Ask for the table in the basement, and you will have a unique dining experience in a very different ""Chambre separée"". And the best experience is perhaps when you ask for the bill: At Krebsegaarden you leave with a happy thought that this is very good value for its price! Only one problem: Few tables available, so Run and book (or at least book early)!","50"

We started with the duck followed by reindeer. Sadly we had no space for a desert. The wine list is extensive and we ordered an italian bottle of Primitivo - which was superb.

"A15WEmikeh","We were on a three week Baltic cruise with stopovers in Copenhagen and London and this was By Far the BEST dining experience on the trip and one of my favorites of all time. The food was exceptional but the service was even better- attentive without smothering. Having the owner greet you at the door (he basically had to flag down the taxi that didn’t know where he was going) and be sure you got a ride as you left is just unheard of service. In between he and our waiter provided great suggestions and delightful banter— all on a night when his wife could have been having a baby. The food was creative and tasty. This is a MUST try kind of place.","50"
"Kay T","My husband and I were so excited to dine here after having emailed the restaurant to see if there were any open availabilities for reservations. One of the owner, Mats, was so hospitable and got us in on a Friday and at a time we requested.   Upon arrival, we were greeted very warmly and were seated immediately. We asked for them to just bring out whatever was best and they paired everything perfectly with the best wines!  The food was made with LOVE and tasted delicious. Every course. Both owners, Mats and Carsten, took VERY good care of us. Mats wife was in labor that evening so he left and Carsten served us the rest of the incredible meal.   We could not ask for anything more out of such an experience. The owners REALLY care about the food and their customers, and it shows.   Carsten even chased us down the street as we left without my scarf! So sweet! We can’t wait to come back when we visit Copenhagen again!  Thank you, Carsten and Mats, for an unforgettable experience and cuisine!","50"
"jpgoldfarb","There are a lot of great places to eat in Copenhagen. This is certainly one of them located in a stylish section of “0ld” Copenhagen. We had the tasting menu with lemon sole, beef, bacaolo, herring sashimi, chocolate petit fours, mousse with paired whites and reds. Well, at the end of the meal I was grinning like an idiot because I was so pleased with everything. The chef is actually Norwegian but the food was so much better than anything in Norway and we have been there twice. He takes a personal interest in his customers so the service was warm and spectacular.","50"

We decide to discover several plates like the bacalau, the stroganoff, the duck, the Apple with ice cream, and much more paired with the right wines . We decide to share all and they bring all plates with generosity portions, they offered several wines to taste and discover the best and the attention to explain all the details with a smile make the difference! The price was a nice surprise for the top quality of the meals and wines! A must if only one day in Copenhagen!","50"

"darshnac2017","On a city break my friend and I sought out this gem of a restaurant after reading glowing reviews. We had not booked, but they squeezed us in because it was relatively early. The service was lovely, we were given time, not rushed in the slightest, each dish was described before we sampled them, making it clear how much these chefs love to interact with the patrons who will be taking their fill here. I have never before eaten essentially raw fish aside from smoked salmon, but the halibut starter was utterly delicious, as was fish main. The wine complemented our meals including the extra indulgence of desserts, and it was simply a joy from start to finish. Thank you to Carston, Mats and Natalie!","50"

"yetanothervince","There are enough great reviews about the food, so let me provide a different perspective. I took my family there (2 adults and 2 kids) and the waiter was very accommodating to our needs, offering to split the food for our kids. He also seemed to know all the tiny little details about every dish - Turned out he was also one of the chefs and one of the owners! I ordered a white wine and I was about to tell him to stop pouring when he said it was a nice Merlot - Turned out it was a specially processed white Merlot from Austria! We all enjoyed our meal and I was glad that we stopped by here while we were in Copenhagen.","50"

"StevenG3522","We went here for dinner on our second night in Copenhagen, mostly based on the strength of the excellent Tripadvisor rating/reviews. As far as a dining experience goes, we both agreed that it was excellent. The food was fresh, delicious and well plated/presented. The wine (by the glass) was well paired and they had various selections from around the world. The service from our main server (who was the head chef) was also excellent. We asked if we could avoid any pickled ingredients in my wifes food selections, (as she was quite adverse to that flavouring and that particular aspect had ruined her meal the night before...see our review of Marv amd Bens) and our server was gracious enough to take the time to make sure her preference was accomdated. Turns out this made all the difference, because once the adjustments were made she really loved the food. I also found the bill to be quite reasonable for the amount and quality of the food/wine we had.....excellent QPR. So, why not 5 stars??? As I have read in some of the previous reviews, the service in this restaurant has been described as “over the top” or “extroverted”. Certainly, it was easy to see the passion and excitement that the servers had for their food, and this seems like a good thing to me. The server that took care of our table for the majority of the evening was warm, friendly, funny and personable. His recommendations were excellent and his manner was prefectly in keeping with the vibe of the establishment. However, there was another server waiting other tables, who on a few occasions came to assist at our table for one reason or another. It was this server whose commentary was completely inappropriate and left a sour taste to our dining experience. Essentially, after learning we were from Canada, we were informed we were from the “good side” (of presumably North America?). Then, he went into a running commentary about how FOX news had attacked Denmark in some documentary...implying it was a socialist society akin to Venezuela. I don’t blame a man for having his own political views, but sharing them with guests in your restaurant uninvited is in poor taste. Please do keep in mind, we had initiated none of these conversational topics amd expressed only our admiration for what we had seen of Denmark so far. Even worse, on the way out the door, he accosted my wife and gave her grief about her asking earlier to modify the food selections to accommodate her aversion to pickled foods. When my wife felt obliged to defend herself, he assured us he was just “joking”. Finally, as we were just leaving the restaurant, he made some comment about us going back to “build that wall”. I guess he had forgotten that we are Canadians, and couldnt resist some parting shot? Not sure what would drive someone in the service industry to make such inappropriate comments, but they were certainly not appreciated, nor deserved. They ended up turning what could have been a great experience into one that was seriously tainted. My advise? Stick to the food and keep political opinions and snarky comments to yourself.","40"
"JodyHatter","My husband and I dined here in May and it gives me great joy to say that this is the best meal I’ve ever eaten (comparing it to restaurants like The Fat Duck, Le Manoir, Dinner, The Hand and Flower).   The food is exceptional - just unlike anything I’ve enjoyed in one meal. The wine was well selected and all the advice we received was spot on. A particular highlight was the cheeseboard and the way it was explained by the owner.   We enjoyed our evening and the service was amazing. We had a good chat with the owners and, because there are only a small number of tables, they had time to chat with us.   You need to book well in advance but this restaurant is soooo worth the effort.","50"
"fatduke","When writing a review, a person is driven not by the above average, average or below average experience, but by the extreme...unless of course this is what pays the bills. In my case I need an extraordinary experience that changes my life to the positive or negative to force me from the comfort of my chosen career to provide words...they say that words are for architects that cannot draw....I (hope) I am one of the those architects that can really draw....but I find myself driven to write about the absolutely involving dinner that I had, quite randomly (after a beer two and looking for somewhere to (Just?) EAT (shame on me) with my colleagues. No description will encompass the care and celebration that Matt's brought to the table...nor the pleasure of selecting the philosophy of Winny the Pooh as way of letting the establishment know what to present us for the following 2 hours. 8 tables in this small unnnasuming venue, yet a myriad of flavours and paired exquisities thanks to the two finest Danish gentlemen ...truly one of my favourite nights... in a room...Awesome awesome awesome...5 out of 5 is not enough","50"

The flavors were excellently combined to create comfort with good taste and lovely presentaiton. One slight negative is that there was no wow factor, it could have been even better... On balance, I thought it was worth the price.  Overall, I highly recommend goiing to the restaurant. Be sure to make a reservation ahead of time. I","50"

"Knittylongstockings","We just loved this place. We had the taster menu, shrimp soup, monkfish cheeks, pork cheek & steak. Followed by the 16 cheeses & 2 desserts for 3 of us. All excellent.

The tasting menu was set up and recomended by Carsten, one of the owners, waiter and chef. It was an amazing experience from start to end - perfect food and great wines. Would also like to add that there is no problem regarding gluten free food. The menu is mainly gluten free, and gluten free bread was provided.","50"

"Lisa B","I'm not sure I have the words to do this restaurant justice in a review as this was quite possibly one of the best meals I've ever had.  The restaurant is an intimate, welcoming and well thought out space run by two best friends. We were invited to eat as much or as little as we liked from the menu all of which sounded amazing. We had a tasting menu with a full size starter and two half mains (fish then lamb) and a dessert each. The passion behind every element of the experience was incredible and I cannot recommend this place enough. We will remember this meal for a long time and will recommend it to any future visitors to Copenhagen. Thank you for a great night. ☺","50"

"S3761LHalisons","We picked this fabulous place from previous Trip Advisor reviews, and decided it would be our special dinner for the week we were visiting our daughter. It did not disappoint! We decided to go with the 5-course tasting menu and wine pairings. My favorite course was the lamb shank with wine reduction sauce that was out of this world. It was paired with a lovely light red wine from Spain. The owner visited our table after every course, and we were made to feel like family. We ended our meal with two different desserts, which were both fabulous (Creme caramel and chocolate marquis with berry coulis). Definitely make a reservation and plan on spending the evening there in the company of other very happy “family” members!","50"

They have a standard menu but also can pick just tasting portions. We could not pick so we just put ourselves in Max's care. We were not disappointed! Food was beautiful, tasty but not pretentious. Definitely save room for the cheese tasting at the end if they offer it. Their wine pairings were spot on as well. Even with all the great spots in Copenhagen I would definitely go back to this spot.","50"

"ElizabethI1234","My other half and I are big foodies. We were excited to try something a bit different and weren’t disappointed. We have eaten in a lot of great restaurants and Krebsegaarden is definitely up there as one of the best!   We had the 5 course taster menu and this is something you should definitely order if you choose to come here. We started with the crayfish salad which was delicious, followed by mussel soup (sounds gross- actually amazing), then we had trout with cream sauce and dill, followed by veal shank in bone marrow gravy. Finally we had 16 different types of Danish cheese before rolling home! The cheese board was well thought out and worked well in the suggested eating order.   If anything we ordered too much delicious food, but the one thing we both loved was the homemade malt and honey bread which went very well with all the courses and the wine pairings. In fact all of the food and drink complimented each other.   I also loved the fact that the waiters were so passionate about the food and spoke to us in detail about each course. Their menu changes to match the artwork in the gallery behind the restaurant. The service was enthusiastic and well informed.   I would definitely recommend this to anyone spending a few days here. Coming from London the menu isn’t that pricey considering the cost of most places in Copenhagen.","50"

"eveiel","Often when you go to a fine dining the restaurant you expect the food to be overly fancy and sometimes unnecessarily fussy. This place has the perfect balance. The food is unbelievably delicious but also has an element of familiarity to it. The portions are perfect sizes. The restaurant is run by he head chef who was charming and constantly talking to the guests explaining the food and wine with his extensive knowledge. The atmosphere was so relaxed and friendly. The Osso Bucco was especially outstanding as was the cheese board where you receive a huge selection of danish cheeses. So pleased we stumbled across this restaurant which I would recommend to anyone visiting Copenhagen.","50"

"480janhendrikm","It‘s hard to write here because it‘ll do the experience a disservice. We tried the tasting menu which was straight-forward, not trying to make psychological statements like other gourmet menues and very delicious. Loved the cheese collection which was probably the best I ever had. You‘ll not leave this place hungry as the few hours tasting menu includes plenty of food in total. All that doesn‘t really matter much though as the experience was dominated (in the most positive sense) by the very good service and the comedian-level humor of the host. My guests and I will never forget this evening. Drop the mic - Krebsegaarden is in the top-3 restaurants I‘ve ever been to.","50"

I loved the whole experience; there were 3 of us and we opted for the Taster menu and left it to our wonderful host to do the choosing for us. We started with the Bergen Fish Soup, followed by duck with a delicious prune and port wine glacé, then Reindeer with a delicious Swedish turnip purée (there were Brussels which I tried but not a favourite of mine lol). Each course was accompanied by a wine pairing. We finished with the Danish cheese board, and some fantastic wines which really complemented them. Every dish and every glass was served with knowledge and passion! We spent 4.5 hours in the company of Carsten and Mats - thank you both for making it so special!!","50"
"oneworldtravelbug","My fiancé and I dined at Souls, Olive Kitchen, Kød, the Red Box, Krebsegaarden, Kødbyens Fiskebar, Cafe Gl.Torv, Le Sommelier, and Zahida while we stayed in Copenhagen for one week. This was our best dining experience of the week, barring one detail. Wonderful concoctions and friendly service most of the night. We ordered the wine pairings along with the 5 course tasting menu and everything was going along marvelously until i expressed, in my humble opinion, a dislike of the NZ Sauvignon Blanc. It not only was not a fine pairing, but exhibited notes of resin. I asked ever so kindly our waiter if he could replace this course with a Plan B, smiling and saying it just wasn't to my liking. For at least the next 30 minutes or so our waiter was more noticeably less friendly, while being overtly friendly to all others in the kitchen, and passed us along to the head chef for most of the remainder of the evening. Curious, but not deserving a one fewer star, I admit. The one fewer comes with a vocal and derogatory rant about customers who don't show after confirming their reservation and how he completely shuns them. This was loud enough and repeated enough that all diners could hear simultaneously. Bringing up the cons of owning a restaurant loudly for a the entire group, albeit small, to engage in and comment on is not my cup of tea. Great service, in my estimation, does not include the personal woes of the day being touted. Finally, by the end the evening, the less than happy server of ours acquiesced and doused us with his spectacular knowledge of Rums, which, when I asked for a 23 yr old Ron Zacapa, he scolded me that that was by no means rum, and by no means 23 yrs old. Since Ron Zacapa comes in several versions, how else was I supposed to specify? Anyway, those were mostly presented gratis, and I do appreciate the gesture. The chef also waited tables and was by far more professional and serious, which I preferred this particular meeting. He explained in painstaking details how each course was prepared, which I loved! BY ALL MEANS go here and dine. Do not let my review do anything but encourage you from this wonderful experience... but watch your opinions as they may be stifled.","40"
"MobileDane","As a local, working just around the corner, I wondered for some time why Krebsegaarden has had these high ratings at Tripadvisor for several years , as it is not particularly well known or hyped among fine dining Copenhageners. Until I finally got a chance to visit with my wife recently and we had such a lovely night. The food was really excellent ned beautifully presented, super wine pairings, and the most attentive and relaxed service by the two Norwegian guys running the place. Ads to that very cosy surroundings and interiors and your are bound to leave the place with a very good feeling in your hart and your stomach. There is not too much space (do they even have a wardrobe?) and the style is not french elegance, but just very pleasant and pretty. It is the good personality and excellent skills of both chefs and waiters that rally makes this place worth visiting. Krebsegaarden is usually booked solid many days in advance, but we were lucky this time to get a (the only) walk-in table. So you may try your luck, but don't count on it.","50"
"404francesl","We celebrated our Thanksgiving this year at the Krebsegaarden and it was certainly a meal to remember!Each truly scrumptious course (not a turkey in sight-yay!) was paired with a delicious wine and presented by the very attentive owner hosts (who happily made slight adjustments to the menu for one family member). Wow! What a fabulous evening. Thank you guys, can’t wait to come back...","50"
"Morris G","The hosts are lovely and engaging and I did not mind the detailed descriptions of the food. The wine recommendations were excellent. They are knowledgeable about food. The food was quite good but the baclao had an over reduced sauce and the crayfish in the signature salad was chewy. The 15 cheese course with three excellent wines was OK but less and a non blue cheese option would have made this the course to have; the cheese samples are too small to appreciate. Not cheap.","40"

"aebcpama","We found this restaurant searching on trip advisor. Tried to get in on Saturday night without a reservation. Not a chance, so we scored a reservation for Wednesday. This meal did not disappoint us, we had the tasting menu, a sample of many dishes that were all to die for! Scallops with Jerusalem artichoke purée, cauliflower soup, pan seared hake with colrabi, radish and beets in a buerre blanc sauce and then a slow cooked pork belly with a bacon mushroom sauce, potato and brussels spouts. Each course had a delicious wine pairing that was perfectly matched to the dish. Dessert was equally good, a creamed carmel, poached pairs, petit fours or a cheese platter with dessert wines. This was more of an event than a meal, truly spectacular from start to finish. Excellent explanations of each dish and each wine. Do not short change yourself by missing this one. This is a restaurant event not to be missed. If I lived in Copenhagen I'd visit every month when the menu changes!","50"
"Aingealmom","This restaurant does not just provide a meal, it provides an experience! The service was exceptional and doubt I have the superlatives to describe the meal accurately.

"Emily S","My husband and I were in Copenhagen to celebrate a milestone birthday and could not be happier with our choice to go to Restaurant Krebsegaarden !! I was initially nervous as my husband is a strict vegetarian so I emailed the general contact email asking if there would be vegetarian options for their daily menu hoping for the best.. When we got there we quickly realized that our server (also the head chef!) had gone above and beyond to create an entire tasting menu based on his restrictions, which was more than just the normal dish minus the meat, but of truly thoughtful and delicious vegetarian dishes. The chef said he had spent the entire day planning out the vegetarian options for our meal and I don't believe he was exaggerating. It was phenomenal. As for myself, I had the un-altered tasting menu and it was the *best* meal of my two week trip. The wine pairing was incredible as well, including unusual and delicious glasses with each dish. We cannot recommend this restaurant enough, make a reservation today.","50"
"Andrew R","Was the meal really as good as I remembered?  I was in Copenhagen five years ago and ended up at dinner here. I walked away (with help) convinced I had just had one of the finest meals of my life. I returned to Copenhagen last month and top of my list was to see if Krebsegaarden really was all that. It was, and more.   Fine dining, without the fuss. The food does the talking though the two Norwegian Chefs bring the charm and humour that makes this restaurant great. The wine pairings was the icing on the cake. Simply splendid and go for the tasting menu.","50"

Adjectives: Incredible, outstanding, unforgettabcle, fun, warm atmosphere w/a live candle and flower on each of the limited number of tables. Don't miss it when you are in Copenhagen, and if you can get a reservation.","50"
"QuentinCooke","I went with my family of four and as many of the reviews say the service is friendly, slightly quirky, but very personable. I thought the food was excellent, but a little over seasoned. I also thought that raw garlic in the salad supporting the langoustine slightly spoiled it, as it overpowered the rest of the dish and gave the salad a sourness that I found unpleasant. I guess it's down to personal choice though. Good quality, overall and a fun evening.","40"

"friedfishfood","We have had the privilege of eating a great places around the world and Krebsegaarden is one of the best. First Mats and Carsten the owner/chefs are amazing. Truly incredible hosts (they tell wonderful stories, share their passion of food, art, music and Copenhagen and make the evening memorable). Second the food is nothing short of spectacular. They are masters of perfect sauces and taste combinations. The mussel soup and the lamb were awe inspiring. Third they pair wines perfectly. We did the six course chefs menu and wine pairings all were spot on and very different. It was like a world tour in one room. I need to repeat how engaging and authentic the owners are. By the end of the evening, we felt like we had made new friends. They even arranged for us to get tickets to the F.C. Køpenhaven opener and told us how to get there on bikes (wonderful). If you are a foodie, this MUST be on your list. If you like meeting interesting people and getting great stories, this MUST be on your list. If you LOVE evenings where you go to dinner and four hours later you are still having lively conversation, lingering over great coffee and after dinner wine and wishing you could do it again the next night, Krebsegaarden must be on your list. We had a great five days in Copenhagen and the very best part of it all was dinner here. - Eric, Rebecca, Max and Sophie","50"

"DanielB011","We got lucky getting a table here, as the night which we wanted to go was booked up online. However, after a phone call with Mats, one of the owners and general dogsbody, informed us of the availability of the private dining room downstairs, upon the condition of ordering a tasting menu set for the table. This suited our purposes (celebratory dinner for 5) perfectly. Upon arrival, we were shown to our table, laid out and prepared for our 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing. Surrounded by original artwork, the multi-lingual raconteur Mats and his equally friendly colleagues made us feel comfortable and welcome, and provided us with a range of delicious dishes. The wine pairings worked well. A list of dietary requirements was provided before our arrival, and the dishes were successfully adapted as required. The food was either spot on, or pushing some taste conventions: the soup was 'too salty' for some of our party, but just right, with a tremendously intense taste of brine exploding the taste buds, for others (myself included). Such reactions are, in my opinion, a good sign, meaning that we are being offered something new and interesting for our money. The various aperitifs and digestifs on offer were also exceptional, from the boutique limoncello through to some intense, memorable liqourice liqour which did indeed perfectly compliment coffee, as recommended. The evening was capped off by a round of well-wishing, hugs and handshakes, as well as a group selfie with Mats himself. Overall, a fine venue with excellent food and a relaxed ambiance, perfect for a date, a foodie, or a celebratory meal.","50"
"Fjordfood","The combination of food high above average, personal service and location in a street with lots of atmosphere - alll this means that you most likely leave with happiness in your heart. Adding that you don't get ruined (however prices in Denmark is not exactly in the lower end in Europe...).  Quite few alternatives on the meny, but what they do they do well. Moreover offering high flexibility if you like to taste different dishes. We aso liked the way of offering glasses of suitable wine to the different dishes - special chosen wines which was not on the regular wine list as far as we understood. Don't miss the ice cream dessert - if you think ice cream is just ice cream then you haven't tried almond ice cream with variations of cherries! What a finish! The norwegian owners/chefs seems to love their work and their guests and add positive vibrations to the experience. As norwegian guests we got quite proud of them!","50"
"jay g","This restaurant is a tiny gem in a great City. The food is well thought out and well prepared. The staff, all of whom seem to be part owners, know everything there is to know about the food's preparation(which is superb), and the perfect matches with the many wines, and even beers, that are available.  What a great find.  my wife and I are going back to Copenhagen just so we ca eat there again","50"
"syzygy66","We thoroughly enjoyed this intimate restaurant, lovingly run by its two chefs. We made online reservations well in advance of our trip. The meal was delicious from start to finish, and part of the fun was hearing the chefs' comments on ingredients and how they created each dish. Definitely recommended if you can nab a spot!","50"
"colinallum","We have a most unusual yet enjoyable evening at this restaurant. Being of the top order the menu (which I understand changes every week) contains few choices - you may like to check before you book because some of our party had to choose food they would not have chosen had their been alternatives. Having said that, the place is friendly and the cooking spectacularly good.... However, beware of the Patron and his choice of wines - not all his choices were to my taste !  Highly recommended","40"
"21lissat","If you are looking for an amazing night out in Copenhagen, you must try this restaurant. It is by far the best experience I have ever had eating out. It was suggested that we try the tasting menu which included a different wine with each course. We were taken on a ""journey"" as we were told and it was quite the journey. Each course came with an explanation of how it was prepared and where the wine we were served came from and sometimes even how it was produced. Make reservations well in advance as it's a small place. The atmosphere is wonderful and by far a wonderful experience.","50"

"jjj637","During our short stay in Copenhagen, we had time to try only ONE of the many restaurants reputed for fine dining experience. After dining at Krebsegaarden, we had no doubts that we made the right choice. If there is one thing missing in most of the top notch restaurants that we have tried in many countries, it is conviviality and a relaxed atmosphere that is missing. In this respect Krebsegaarden was the exception. Mats Wergeland lived up to his stated philosophy of offering a ""homey & relaxed atmosphere"". This enhanced the culinary experience considerably. It was as if we were dining at Mats' home as his personal guests. Every dish and its paired wine was a topic of discussion and exchange of views leading to a greater appreciation of the qualities of the dishes and the wines. The tasting menu was a delightful combination of an ""a-la-carte"" selection and ""tasting"" portions. This was again a first for us. We chose the 'only sea food' route and every dish (brown shrimp in browned butter, cray fish salad, marinated red fish escabeche and bacalao), was outstanding. If we lived in Copenhagen we would have loved to try his concept of ""menu will always be inspired by the current exhibition in Gallery Krebsen""!! Definitely ""worth the detour"" and ""one of its kind"" category. Bravo Mats & Carston","50"
"kylvag","We came to celebrate my father's 80th birthday, and could not have gotten a better experience. The owners agreed to open the restaurant a half hour early to fit our schedule, they greeted us already before we entered the restaurant, they gave us a tour of the attached gallery and they served and introduced each dish and each wine individually. Every dish was an experience, and every wine memorable. A top notch experience, thanks to the owners for giving us such a great day.","50"
"Ines N","Dinning at the Krebsegaarden was the gastronomic highlight of our recent foodie trip to Copenhagen and the most perfect way for me to enter my 40's. Not only food was absolutely divine in itself but the exquisit wine pairing proposed to us brought the experience up to an almost quasi religious level. To top it all up Mats & Carsten's bubbly personalities, amazing service, passion and knowledge completed the holy trinity... Food, ambient and service.   Obrigado!","50"
"lmc556","We booked this restaurant for our first meal after our cruise. The restaurant is cosy and service is absolutely impeccable.  We went for the tasting menu with wine pairing. It's the best meal we had and the explanation and passion was evident in Mats and Carston. Love every dish and we thought it was a good value.","50"
"Steven S","Mats and Carsten really put their hearts and minds into the menu and wine selection. If you want to know what you are eating, where it came from, how it was made, why its inspired by the art show in the back garden, and what characteristics of the wine paired with each course is especially complimentary of the flavors - this is the place for you. I've never experienced such a high volume of quality information about cooking technique and the providence of the ingredients delivered with such a friendly enthusiastic and informal style as Mats and Carsten deliver with every dinner service. Clearly a place you could go 6 times a year and never be board. And be sure to ask Mats about where the rum comes from - that produces quite and enthusiastic lecture about distilleries and barrel aging techniques. Needless to say we had the best time enjoying a really high quality meal with a ton of info about every aspect. Last time we were so inundated with details was at Per Se in NY. And they were so nice about splitting plates as we obviously intended to share. And the downstairs ""party"" or ""private"" dining room looks like a really nice space to host 8 or 10 for dinner. And the service is by Mats and Carsten themselves, so it really is outstanding.","50"
"NomadicSandra","Four of us did the tasting menu. The wine selection was paired with a delicious asparagus soup, guinea fowl, a new fish I've never tried and rhubarb tart with rhubarb ice cream. All the courses were divine and Mats and his staff made the evening more enjoyable. Easy to see why this place is so highly reviewed and we felt fortunate to eat at such an intimate and delicious place. Would highly recommend for a full taste of Denmark!","50"
"Will S","We went for dinner on Friday night and everything about the experience was wonderful. The two head chefs were extremely charismatic and passionate; able to explain the dishes in great detail and offer many amusing anecdotes over the course of the evening. The food was fabulous, full of intricate flavours which all came together, the red snapper and the cray fish salad were particular highlights.   The wine pairing actually managed to outshine the food though - I read a couple of reviews which questioned the value of money but I would have to strongly contradict these. Considering we were in Copenhagen I thought the wine pairing option was extremely reasonable! We had 7 wines in all, 3 of these coming as part of the ginormous 17 cheese cheeseboard! I wasn't disappointed with any of the glasses and 2 or 3 of them were outstanding.  Overall would say very deserving of its 5 star rating.","50"

"Monc444","Booked this since they had so good reviews and was expecting a lot but got more! Mats greeted us when we came and after that we had a great evening with fantastic food and wine. We went for the tasting menu with a wine package, a very good choice. All the dishes were more than tasty and so well presented, I can still get the feeling of the smell of butter that came with the fish. Amazing! A very small restaurant and I hope they keep it that way, we all felt like home and when we left we all hugged Mats :)","50"
"ClaireStarr24","Oh this is a wee gem that mustn't be missed - it is under-priced for the incredible evening we had! We were welcomed by the manager and then the chef took us through the menu - we decided to go for the taster menu - two starters, two main courses and, if we would like a dessert. Each dish was beautifully created with the flavours exquisite. We were offered wine recommendations, but, I for example, don't like red wine, I was given a little to try, but said I would prefer white and I got to choose to continue with the wine I had enjoyed with the previous dish. I loved the crayfish salad, the cod in tomato was perfect, the slow cooked yet pink fillet of beef, was soft, juicy and melted in the mouth. I was full after and didn't want a dessert, but my husband had the most incredible cheese board!! It was the highlight of our whole holiday!!","50"
"moreactivetravel","Fantastic experience.   You'll leave feeling you've had an absolute feast, gastronomic experience and made new friends.   Small, intimate, quaint restaurant. The menu changes regularly, inspired by work in the art gallery nearby. The menu is not extensive, they focus on a doing a small number of dishes really well.   The passion and commitment of the guys that run this place really comes across as they describe each dish and their chosen wine pairings.   The beef was excellent. Marinated pear dessert just divine, working brilliantly with the Swedish ice cider it was paired with.   ","50"
"Benski R","I have waited almost a month to write this review to make sure I still felt the way I did when we ate here. I still do and have raved about it ever since. I so just want to go back and eat it all again. Its a tiny place - holds maybe 30 people. we were early and met by the chef/owner, what a geezer! Passionate, informed, welcoming and did I say passionate? I initially thought the menu was limited but we discussed our thoughts and we went with a six plate tasting menu with associated wine recommendations. One starter, three mains (which was all of them) and two desserts. Well one dessert and a cheeseboard of 17 cheeses and three different wines. We stayed there for almost four hours. I have never tasted food and cheese like it before. Some mouthfuls were so wonderful we just looked at each other in utter amazement. Am scared to return in case it shatters the memory but am willing to find out. For two our bill came to just over £200 which for what we experienced I would happily eat there three times than eat at Kadeau once! Just saying.....","50"
"Mladen2013","The food is very good ,nice cooked and tastes fine . What we didn't like is the way we have been pushed to order the wine which was recommended to us .

"Elizabeth C","I feel like my friend and I were pressured into having the Taster Menu although we just wanted the normal a la carte menu. There was no price on the Taster Menu and the waiter did not offer this information to us when he was selling us this option. The prices were included for each item on the normal menu which we thought looked very reasonably priced but boy were we in for a shock when our bill arrived. It was much more than we expected. Much more than if we had ordered a starter and a main from the a la carte menu. And for less food. We were not remotely full after having tiny tastes of 4 dishes. I think the quality of the food was superb but I do not think it was good value for money. Also for the wine pairings again there were no prices. And we were served the wine for each pairing so early that sometimes when the food arrived the waiter gave us a sip more wine so we could taste it with the food pairing but then he charged us very dearly for that extra tiny sip. Lovely restaurant, friendly server, but overall not satisfied with this restaurant.","30"

"Sally P","A top ranking inevitably boosts expectations sky high, so we anticipated at least some level of disappointment when we had dinner at Krebsegaarden on Friday evening. It was, however, a wonderful experience, and the reviews really don't do full justice to this amazing restaurant. The restaurant itself is tiny; simply. and stylishly furnished with only six or seven tables. We were greeted by Mats, who is a big personality and absolutely in his element when it comes to describing the food and explaining the provenance of each wine. We simply put ourself in Mats' hands and ended up with an amazing five course tester menu with matching wine pairings. The flavours were fantastic, with a beautiful crayfish starter, and a later serving of smoked eel being the highlights. The wines were equally impressive and Mats is clearly as skilled a sommelier as he is a chef. This is clever, careful, skilful cooking and every element is beautifully presented and each dish superbly balanced. Portions are sensible, prices are relatively modest for the quality of food and service ( our bill totalled about £80 per head including all the food, water, breads and five glasses of wine each). We also had fun here - there's a refreshing informality to the style of service, and the delightful sounds of laughter, along with plenty of sighs of culinary appreciation provided the soundtrack for a really magical evening.","50"
"Tiggmin","We had a fantastic night the food was excellent, we had a large enough group of 11 people but felt like we got a really personal service each course was explained as was the accompanying wine. We also had a combination of Swedish, French, Belgian and English speakers and they catered for all languages. Looked after the vegan in the group of really well. One of the best news nights with a large work group highly recommend a visit.","50"
"nancyd3","The food here is very good; the chef's passion and the style of service is what makes this a very special evening out. This restaurant is quite small - perhaps nine tables - and they are very serious about confirming your reservation. This makes perfect sense given the very intimate environment of the whole experience.  I wanted to try the tasting menu, but the entire table wasn't committed so we ordered a la carte. My starter was a crayfish dish that included a beautiful ""salad"" of yellow peppers, citrus and all sorts of wonderful tastes. The chef explanation that comes with each dish is worthy of being in a Penthouse Gourmet magazine mashup. My main dish was a bacalao (cod) in a wonderful tomato sauce. It was good, but it was not the highlight of the meal which was.... the cheese course for dessert. 17 tasty cheeses - one bite each - with each cow or sheep personally described.  Do yourself a favor and let Matt pick the wines for you - don't even bother looking at the wine list. He paired each course with a glass of wine (and is happy to pour a half glass if that is better for you) and then teh cheese course came with three different wines.  An amazing experience for foodies of all descriptions. Go and enjoy the event that it is!","50"

"Ricsid101","One of the most fantastic meals I've ever eaten it's as simple as that. The service is attentive, fun and knowledgeable (big thanks to Mads for the whiskey selection) and the food is off the chart. So much flavour from simple things but cooked with passion and great skill. I've eaten in restaurants by Gordon Ramsey, Heston Bluemthal and Jason Atherton and this blows them all out of the water. If you find yourself in Copenhagen do yourself a favour and pay these guys a visit, you wont regret it.","50"

"KateFD","We were really pleased we ate here. The menu is limited (I suspect a veggie would struggle) but the flavours of all the food (and wine) were excellent and it was nice to have a choice of portion size. The patrons are clearly passionate about the food and keen to pass on their enthusiasm. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star review is that not only did they not serve decaf coffee (many restaurants in Denmark seem not to), but they brushed off my request for somr with the comment 'we don't see the point in it'. The point is that I like the taste of coffee after my meal, but if I have caffeine I will be awake all night. I am not alone in this, and I think the attitude needs to be reconsidered.","40"

"ThePughs14","We booked this as our second gourmet meal during our 4 night break. Our first being the excellent Radio which we had been to before. Anyway Krebsegaarden was selected partly due to unable to get into Noma, (yes I know we really didn't stand a chance of that one!) and so we plumbed for this based on the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor.  And it was superb from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Excellent service from charming hosts, football being a great topic alongside discussing the food and wine. We took the tasting menu approach, and whilst the starters and main courses were the same between the two of us, we were able to diverge at the dessert stage as I selected the cheeseboard and my wife went for something sweeter. My wife didn't want to have too much wine so was going to have a single glass of wine, but incredibly it was suggested that she could enjoy the wine flight but in quarter glass servings! Fantastic idea and meant we could both savour the excellent wines at each course.  The food was excellent, deliciously prepared and presented, and whilst not as Nordic as Radio, in that they use non-Nordic ingredients occasionally such as olive oil in their cooking, it was all simply delicious whether fish, meat or vegetable! For me the crowning glory was the stupendous cheeseboard - a platter of, I think of at least 12 small morsels of pure Danish cheese....some quite startling in taste and texture, beautifully explained and taken in stages with excellent additional sweet wine pairing. Would we return - oh yes for all of the above, great hosts, delicious food, honest wines, and to try the cheeseboard again! And of course at a far more reasonable cost than Noma and some of the other restaurants in Copenhagen. Oh and if you book do make sure you turn up as it is a small business and unbelievably people still book, confirm and then don't attend.","50"
"mlsmlsmlsmls","We preordered a table because the restaurant was on the top of ratings over restaurants in Cobenhagen. The service was the best I experienced on our stay. But I might have had very high expectations, because I experienced the flavors to be a bit dull for my palette. Loved the way the nicest guys explained how they cooked the food, with a lot of passion, but it still became a bit pricy and blend for us.  We will not be revisiting, if not just to talk to the Norwegian chef. He was so nice, maybe it would be worth the pricy menu.","30"

The guys have a wonderful sense of humor and the dishes are explained in detail, but perhaps our expectations were a bit high.

From the Fish Soup w Mussels and Bacon to the Trout w Cauliflower and Dill Sauce to the Pork Cheeks braised in Beer to the Desert.  Many in our group went for the plateau of cheese (17 different ones) all wonderfully presented in small one bite portions. We chose the Chocolate Cake which was to Die For.

Mads is an excellent host knowledgable and friendly. The wine selection to accompany the meal was well paired an excellent Chardonnay from France, a pecorino, an Austrian red followed by a first class Italian red. The highlight of the evening for me was the cheese selection a rollercoaster of a ride from some of the finest cheeses in Denmark if you like cheese as I do do not miss, there are fifteen of them!! Mads and his team deserve their place as number 1. This restaurant is all about the people and the food exactly what a great restaurant should be. Thank you and well done Mads.","50"

We chose to have the tasting menu as this was our first trip to Denmark and wanted a feel of various authentic Danish cuisine. The food was excellent; favourites were the cod and my partner's the reindeer. The wine was perfect; specifically accompanying each dish.  I managed to be lucky enough to think to book a couple of months in advance before our trip and would recommend for those who wish to go to do the same as it's a must to try if looking for a special evening for fine dining.","50"

We were most excited to try the cheese board again and it was even better than we remembered first time round.   If you visit any restaurant in Copenhagen, make it this one!

"PVL0ver","This was our most memorable meal of our 10 day trip to Copenhagen and Amsterdam. It is an experience in fine dining. The staff will meet and greet, and get to know you over the course of the evening. They will explain in detail how each dish briis prepared, and will match your wines for you. My appetizer was leg of deer...sound a bit weird, but it was wonderful. It was fun to watch the reactions of the other diners...a very discerning British gentleman was at the next table, and he exclaimed his main course was ""absolutely brilliant"". I agree. This place is special.","50"

"AJ_Bluejays","I recently came here with my wife for her birthday while we were in Copenhagen on our honeymoon. The staff were very attentive, friendly, and knowledgable the entire time we were at the restaurant. The decor and atmosphere is cozy and works well.  The menu is indeed a very small menu but it is evident each item has been well thought out. We were both provided lots of information about the food and how it is cooked. Everything we tasted was amazing and did not disappoint. The bread and honey butter provided as part of the meal was possibly the best I have ever had as well.  Out of all the food we tried in Copenhagen over five days, this was by far the best we tried and the service was top notch. Do yourself a favour and attend what has to be one of the best Danish restaurants!","50"
"Steve P","I was apprehensive! My daughter had picked Krebsegaarden from the internet, probably Trip Advisor! and booked it as a surprise for me on my birthday tour. We went with friends who live outside Copenhagen and had never heard of it and arriving early for dinner the place was empty and l feared it would be overrated. I needn't have worried. By mid evening it was full and now we know why. We were welcomed and made to feel special. The menu is small, but every dish is well crafted and explained to you in great detail paying attention to provenance and why each ingredient has been chosen. The wine recommendations were spot on and complemented our food choices. The staff are caring and attentive without being overbearing and are willing it would seem to chat about just about anything in Danish or English. Ask where the crayfish come from or how the meal is cooked and you can get a 10 minute explanation with historical references. If you enjoy fine dining and great food this place is a dream. It isn't cheap but then anything of this quality will never be.","50"
"Mikev876","Great find in copenhagen. Natural local ingredients, great winw pairing. The veal tongue, jeruzalem artichoke soup and monk fish were all great.

"Porsche_Guy","Dining at Restaurant Krebsegaarden is about more then a meal; it's all about an experience. The walk to the restaurant, in our case, from the central train station, involved a stroll through the HC Andersens pedestrian shopping area and into the area of Copenhagen University. The entire walk is a visual treat, and to regarded as a part of the overall Food Art experience.  Restaurant Krebsegaarden is on a small street aptly named Studiestræde, in the university area. On the evening of our visit Carsten welcomed us warmly into the room and made us feel at once at home. The room is bright, warmly lit, with a collection of engaging photographic prints on the walls. Carsten and Mats are gregarious, professionals who are quick to engage and inform guests about the menu, the ingredients and preparation details, and even brief Scandinavian history and politics lessons -if the guests express interest. Krebsegaarden is not a quite, reserved place. If this is the atmosphere you seek, Krebsegaarden is not the right place.  Our meal was spectacular. Everything from bread to coffee, including the details of service was remarkable. Service is done either by Carsten or by Mats, so there is constant interaction with them. Their attention to detail is impeccable. Starting with the Crayfish salad, moving to the wild boar, and on to the home made chocolates, each course was delicious, perfectly plated, and timed to reach us at the appropriate moment. Nice touch gentlemen.   At the end of our meal, in passing, we mentioned to Mats that we were on our way to a different establishment for some late evening whiskey. The next moment Carsten was bringing to our table an extensive selection of spirits, providing detailed explanations and tasting notes for each. Once we narrowed down our choice, Mats even offered small tastes so we could be happy with our choices.   One nice and unexpected touch was the fluffy, fresh hand towels downstairs where I went to freshen up upon arrival. Again. Nice touch gentlemen!  We are planning a follow-up visit to Copehnagen, designing our visit around dinner at Restaurant Krebsegaarden.","50"

Would highly recommend a visit to this restaurant.","50"
"edbroo","What an amazing restaurant. Must admit we're a bit apprehensive about eating here - it was our first night in Copenhagen and we jumped in with both feet...  ...and oh boy I'm glad we did. We actually visited back in November 2014 and this was the perfect introduction to Copenhagen's food and art culture.   The menu was a real journey, all locally sourced and fresh, a real delight. When we visited, the super friendly chef took time to visit each table and discuss choices, his background and the story behind each dish, happily chatting through each stage of its preparation. For me the lamb broth (consommé) was outstanding but of all the memories, the most vivid was the cheese course...and the aptly named ""oh my god cheese"". Can safely say I've never tasted cheese like this - nor since! It was amazing.   This was more than a meal, it was a welcome culinary education and phenomenal taste sensation.","50"
"Ben G","We could not have chosen a better place to be on our first night in Copenhagen. From the genuine warm welcome the moment we arrived until the heartfelt goodbye we knew we were where we wanted to be. Mats and his crew have a way of making you feel so comfortable it's as if you are eating at a friend's house. Only difference being, you don't have a friend who can cook like these guys. Do not order a bottle of wine. You will be much better served if you let them them pair the wines. We choose the tasting menu which is a great way to go. Just to put this review in context, my wife and are very demanding when it comes to restaurants but we also know how to praise restaurants that deserve it. This is one of them!","50"

"travelingmom74150","I loved this restaurant - the food, the hosts, the sometimes overlong explanations about the dished. Had I simply wanted to have a quiet meal with my husband, I might have found the whole thing overwhelming, but we appreciated all the information and the whiskey tasting at the end of the meal. The restaurant is tiny and the menu small- delicious, but not a lot of choices. We went with the 5-course tasting menu and had the crayfish, very light and fresh, another starter; the bacalao, which has a lot of a very delicious tomato sauce; the turbot with horseradish, which I thought overpowered the fish slightly; and the ox which was also very good. Not sure I really got the connection between the food and the art, but the food was good. We appreciated the wine pairings and the enthusiasm of the staff/owners. I would definitely return if I ever find myself in Copenhagen again.","50"
"lindarX5316AS","We were two couples who enjoyed the dinner thoroughly. My husband and I didn't try the tasting menu but started with the roasted cauliflower soup which was garnished with truffle oil and roasted cauliflower florets. This was absolutely delightful and we followed this with the local fish called plaice which was a flounder very much in season and it was stuffed with fresh dill, thyme and lemon verbena and accompanied by smashed new potatoes with very generous amounts of fresh herbs and butter. We followed the suggestions of Mats on wine selections and they were perfect. Our only complaint was having to listen to a bit of a lecture on the state of the presidential election back home. This had nothing to do with dinner but was a bit of a downer to start a fine meal with. Because everything was exceptional I will let this go in my rating! Excellent service, ambiance and experience overall.","50"

Welcome was very warm with Mats providing an extra attraction for the evening with his football stories and general bonhomie. We chose the tasting menu which included mushroom soup, chicken terrine, cod in tomato and roast oxen (these are very basic descriptions of exquisitely presented dishes). With each course a different glass of wine was included, complementing the food well. We were too full to have dessert but the table next to us had the cheese board which turned out to be 16 different cheeses with 5 glasses of wine! You'd better be hungry. Service was attentive and we were never short of bread or water, all in all a fantastic experience which we intend to replicate when we next visit Copenhagen. Well done Mats and Carsten.","50"
"Daphne L","A weekend in Copenhagen must include at least on or two special restaurant visits and while we had not left enough time to arrange a reservation at one of the world’s most famous places, we did secure a table here, the second most highly ranked place on TA. Going to Krebsgaarden is not really about going out for dinner but more about taking a step into Mads’ world where he has been working tirelessly with his team to craft a specially prepared range of dishes – finely curated and honed with a great amount of passion and focus. What you are served up is the result of a work of genius. If you have the appetite and ambition, I would recommend going for the full menu with each dish being accompanied by a special wine chosen to match it. But leave room for the cheese platter because that really is the piece de resistance. The great thing about this place is that the menu changes each month and it matches the season as well as taking its inspiration from the art on the walls.  Following a few amuses-bouches, we started with a chanterelle soup that if I remember correctly had been boiled down for three days. Mads and his oppo are so well-versed in every aspect of the dishes that they can actually describe the pots they have been cooked in. In fact if the subject comes up, the pots can be produced and the cooking method intricately walked through. Mads makes a study of his wines. In some cases he has lovingly kept the bottles in his cellar for years, in others he has discovered them only recently. Whatever the source if he is recommending it to go with a course there is a very good reason and throughout the menu and the various cheeses we must have tried a good 7 varieties.  My husband and I have eaten in many places around the world and in some cases these have been Michelin starred places but we have to say that this is a destination that is truly special.  The Danish hospitality is infused into the experience from the first second you enter the place until you finally leave and are fondly bid ‘au revoir’ by the hosts. We would honestly say that we have never been to a place like this. We would recommend it unreservedly and advise you to go with an open mind and an empty stomach ready to be blown away by flavours and astounded by the acrobatics that the chefs have gone through to bring the ingredients together on the plate. A must when in Copenhagen.","50"
"WilliamT909","Absent the reviews on Trip advisor, we would never have found this tiny place down a one-way street near a university. And what a find it was! We concur with the previous laudatory reviews. The format is a bit ""different"", in a nice way, with the owner-chefs serving you and telling you precisely what is in each dish and how it is prepared. The menu is brief, so between the four of us we had almost everything on it. The tasting offer had what we found to be a slightly odd rule that everyone had to order the exact same choices, so we went a la carte instead. Everything was lovingly prepared and presented without undue flourishes. The style was very conversational, which we enjoyed. Wine pairing suggestions were spot on. Had a great and entertaining time. First time I ever saw a chef rushing out into the street to hail customers a cab!","50"

"Chloe B","This place really is a jem. Me and my partner went here last night and we were very lucky to get a table as it is a very small place. I was desperate to get in and I had to call back to see if their were any cancellations just so we could get a table. We had the 4 course tasting menu, along with the accompanying wine and for dessert the cheese tasting board and also the accompanying wine. The menu and each wine was explained brilliantly. The food was absolutely delicious and it was beautifully presented, the flavours were stunning and the wine complimented the food very well. The cheese board was incredible, we went on a journey of taste. The different cheeses were explained well and all had very unique flavours, some very mild and creamy, others very strong and flavoursome and the wines went beautifully with each one.  The service was exceptional! I was very impressed when the guy at the door, who we learnt was the owner, Mats, not only remembered me from the phone but also remembered my name! Himself and the main chef were very friendly and welcoming and they made us feel like old friends.  The atmosphere was great, it was very cosy and Mats and chef made everyone feel comfortable. They learnt that we were football fans and we had some fantastic banter about our team and theirs and we were even invited to watch a game with them next week.  The dining experience was the best I've ever had, It really was. It wasn't overpriced and the potion sizes were perfect. Considering we had the 4 course tasting menu, with wine, the cheese board, also with wine and coffee to end, our bill of 1700DDK felt to us, very fitting. I would 100% recommend this place and I will certainly be visiting again. Upon leaving Mats told me he was glad we called back as he was holding the table for us!  My pictures show how beautiful the food is unfortunately I didn't take a picture of my soup as I was too busy eating it! Oops!","50"
"WBRT","The food is prepared with a lot of effort and care - tasting heavenly, and the service is impeccable to each guest - both the old and the young in the family. The prices are very seasonable especially considering the high quality. Seemed hard to get a table so try to book in advance.","50"

"wanderingmillenial24","This meal was not only delicious but the service was incredible. Both the waiter and the chef himself told us about every dish we ate in detail. You could tell the chef was so passionate about what he does. My husband and I ordered separate main courses and he asked if we were planning on trying each one. We said yes and he told us that he would spilt each course and bring each item out individually so they could be enjoyed as they were intended. They even split out glasses of wine to pair with the meal. That in my mind is going above and beyond. That's before even talking about the food. Everything was incredibly delicious and you can tell such care went into the preparation. Make sure you book in advance however. I heard someone try to get a table without a reservation and he mentioned they were booked through October. Do a little planning and don't miss out!!","50"
"hansvana","During our recent trip to Copenhagen we ended up in the Krebsegaarden. Here the owners Mats and Carsten and their team were just back from their holidays. We were Lucky to get a table. After discussing the UEFA selection of FC Copenhagen with Mats he advised us on the chefs (Carsten) best picks for the night. This proved to be an excellent selection of great foods that were accompanied by a great variety of nicely paired wines. Particularly the Snoquamie wine was an unexpected treat! The fact that there also was a (performing) Finnish choir-group in the house (not every day apparrantly) made the food/wine experience one of the most unforgettable nights for us in Copenhagen.These guys from Norway do a fantastic job in Copenhagen.","50"

"stacey s","We were recently in Copenhagen and only had a few nights, yet, we went to have dinner here twice, that is how good it was. This restaurant/art gallery is relatively small, with only a few tables upstairs and a few more downstairs, so reservations are recommended. As soon as you walk in you are greeted like family. The owners/chefs are world class. It is not cheap, but not outrageously expensive either, but for the quality you are getting it is actually quite a bargain. I recommend the tasting menu where you can select several entrees to try. The ambiance is cozy and is a perfect place to take someone special. The main reason we love this restaurant is that we think the food and service is good enough to warrant a Michelin Star. we consider ourselves foodies and if you look at my other reviews you won't see this type of recommendation. Their current menu features grilled trout, baba genouch, cold yoghurt sauce and dill potatoes, variation of guinea fowl with chanterelles and wild rice, Bacalao of the house (a very Danish/Norwegian dish). Take as much time as you need to eat, get the wine pairings (the wine is very affordable), try a couple of desserts and don't forget to leave with a hug or handshake.","50"

"DrSteve818","When one speaks of gastronomy, we think of the relationship between food, culture, and art, and this is truly summed up at Restaurant KrebseGaarden. I had the read the reviews here and the elsewhere and we made our reservation nearly 2 months in advance, the minute they opened up for the one and only day we would be passing through Copenhagen during our summer travels, and all I can say is WOW! This has to be tied for first place as the best restaurant that I have even dined at (tied of first place with Gastronome in London, where we dined the month earlier). We opted for the tasting menu paired with wine, and everything was prepared fantastically and had rich and deep flavors, albeit a bit saltier the I normally enjoy. One item that stands out was the first appetizer which was South German Onion Tart with Créme Fraiche Dressing and ""Windblown"" Pork, from pigs that live in a windblown area of Denmark and thus the lifestyle of the animal affects the taste. Although we did not have food allergies, I heard Carsten and Mats talking to other diners about the option to prepare their experience sans the food(s) that they are allergic to; they are to be commended for that. I've attached some pictures to this review. Next time we are in Europe, we will deliberately make Copenhagen part of our journey so that we can dine again at Restaurant KrebseGaarden.  One fun thing: We started dinner at 6:00pm and finished about 9:00pm, and then walked 2 short blocks for an after-dinner movie date late show which was fun. It's a 20-plex movie theater.","50"
"DebSB57","We had dinner here last year and it's one of the reasons we had to return to Copenhagen this year. I made reservations as soon as they opened for the day we wanted to go. What a place! What an experience! We chose the tasting menu - 5 courses, 5 different wines, plus dessert. The content and preparation was described for each course, though briefly and not in a way that interfered with spending time with my husband. Each course, each wine was better than the next. And our hosts! What a pair. Carsten so charming, and Mats, telling us all about the music selections - we'd asked about them. He used to be a DJ and we would purchase his compilations were they available! Everything from local artists to Nina Simone, James Brown and the Beatles. Plus interesting art on the walls. And not nearly so expensive as you might expect. AND, when you leave, both Carsten and Mats meet you at the door, shake your hand and thank you for coming. We may have to return to Copenhagen every year.","50"

The restaurant's location on a street with run-of-the-mill bars, etc., is very deceptive of it's exceptional quality and overall experience.","50"

Altogether the evening proved a highlight of our short stay in Copenhagen and we will certainly come again.","50"

Where it is fish or meat, the food was fantastic. The soups were divine. The flavors were robust and you can tell that they were intricately made and served beautifully. I couldn't rate a restaurant higher than this one.","50"
"catlady-usa","Very nice food and staff. we all had the tasting menu, my husband had a beer with his meal, my son and I select the wine pairing with meal. very impressive. will recommend to my friends and family.","50"
"twotravels","It is number one on Trip Advisor for a reason. My husband and I selected the wine pairing with our meal and everything was perfect. We were placed near the window which we asked for, the two owners described each wine and how the food was prepared and treated us like we were the guests of honor. It was fantastic experience and we would recommend it highly to our family and friends. The next night we ate at another top restaurant in Copenhagen and the atmosphere was lacking, food did not compare nor did the price which was more expensive than Krebsegaarden. Thank you for making this evening a memorable one for us.","50"
"pausuemel","12 people, five course tasting menu with wine pairing. Great food and wine served with warmth, humor and a passion for what they are doing. Well worth every kroner.","50"
"610TimH610","We booked this tiny restaurant on the recommendation of a friend who had visited earlier in the year and thought it was amazing. We are so pleased we listened and booked for dinner.   Run by Carsten (Chef) and Mats (FOH), the tiny restaurant's menu is influenced by the artists and artworks displayed in their art gallery (with some on the walls of the restaurant as well). Mats is an amazing host - he knows exactly where the produce he is using comes from - whether a local cheese or an Italian wine.   We decided to have the tasting menu (with matching wines) and leave the choices up to Mats and Carsten. Pickled radish with honey and goats cheese, crayfish salad, pike perch, pork brisket and a truly amazing selection of 16 Danish cheeses (also with 3 different wines) was selected. An excellent selection and absolutely delicious - fresh tasting, expertly cooked, great wine pairing and amazing service.   Highly recommended and will be back for another tasting soon.","50"

"Joen F","I went to Krebsegaarden after having waited three months and I'll tell youthat these three months were well worth the waiting time. Having eaten at perhaps +100 top tripadvisor restaurants while travelling around the last 18 months, Krebsegaarden take the first spot when it comes to service and atmosphere.   The restaurant owners are also the waiting staff, which makes the experience so personal and engaging. With every course comes a story, insight or sometimes a witty comment as a result of the informal down-to-earth atmosphere. You can just feel how passionated the chefs/waiters are and its not just passion. Its also knowledge. They appear to be tremendous wine experts and magicians with food experimentation.   The food was all new for me given the amount of creativity put into it. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the four courses along with the perfectly assembled wine menu.   Krebsegaarden is my new favourite restaurant in Copenhagen and a personal top 3 on an international scale.   I will be putting in my next booking as we speak.   Thanks again.","50"
"curtsmith101","When we got to the restaurant the outside wasn't the most appealing, but don't let that stop you from going in. The food is all prepared to order and the guys will put any combination of menu items together as a tasting menu. They have been open almost 10 years and the owners are in the kitchen and on the floor working to make sure your meal is a special experience. Ours was that and more. Mats one of the owners kept us laughing with his stories and his explanations of the menu items. Be sure to let them pair wines with your courses as they know their wines and foods. A really fabulous time.","50"
"brudawsky","I booked our table for this restaurant several weeks in advance due to it's amazing reviews. I was in Copenhagen with my sister and elderly father and I really had no idea what to expect but just wanted a really good meal. We were a little concerned when the area seemed off the beaten path and there is construction going on all around. But we decided to go ahead and give it a try - We are so glad we did as it is a meal that we will never forget. We did the 6 course tasting menu so that we could all sample a little bit of most of the menu. My sister and I also did the wine pairing with each course. Each course was a work of art and the flavors were incredible. And the wine pairings were perfect as well. Part of what made this meal even more amazing was our interaction with our server, Carson. He was a pleasure to spend our evening with and was attentive and informative. We would go back in a heartbeat.","50"
"adspharm","A truly great experience - one of the best meals I have ever had! Each item of food was extremely tasty in a subtle and pleasing way - we had the tasting menu. The presentation was a pure delight, with several interesting conversations with each of the Norwegian chefs. The wines that were suggested fitted perfectly. I cannot praise this restaurant too highly - they clearly care greatly about food and how to present it. The ambience is quiet, although the restaurant is small. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food, and less than one usually has to pay for this quality in Copenhagen - which makes you feel good when you leave. Booking is essential.","50"

"aWayfaringSwede","To be guided through a five course Scandinavian menu by Mats and his team is to be guided through some of the best of what the Scandinavian cuisine has to offer.   When each course is a celebration to the ingredients found locally and each wine pairing is a perfect match there is no wonder that this small and cozy restaurant is filled with laughter and pleasant conversation.   Perfect for friends and families out for a treat. Make sure you are not in any time stress. The night will move forward in the pace of the kitchen. And do go for the set menu, it's a great value for money","50"

We were 2 persons driving and the waiter managed to make sure the wine followed the different menus in just the right size so you could legally drive away and still have a great tasting experience. The knowledge about the wine and the food is just outstanding. And the food itself is just magnificent. Well definitely return! Please be aware that in weekends they sometimes have 12 weeks waiting time. However, if you can’t book online try to call. We got a table the same day – great service!","50"

"Westontraveller1231","As a solo traveler, I never really know how I'm going to be treated when I make a reservation for one at a top-rated restaurant. From the moment I walked into Restaurant Krebsegaarden and was greeted by Mats, I felt like I was in a friend's home, warm, and relaxed. The food is exceptional but what makes it truly an experience that shouldn't be missed is the gracious of the two owners and chefs. I chose the tasting menu along with a flight of appropriate wines. Each course was presented beautifully but what was special is that it was accompanied by a thorough explanation of what I was eating. They are creative, amazing chefs and each course was mouth-wateringly good. What a lovely, lovely evening I had which ended by both owners coming out to say goodnight to me as I got into my taxi. Special, special place","50"
"rfbharper123","We had booked a table here for our first night in Copenhagen and I’m so pleased we did, it set the high bar that nowhere else surpassed on our trip. We went for the tasting menu and wine pairing which was a fantastic option and not hugely expensive, the food was sublime. We had delicious fish dishes, one in particular, a white fish with a tomato based rich sauce which was spectacular. We also had an excellent pork dish with a 3 day slow cooked sauce which was again one of the tastiest dishes I’ve had in a long time. The wine with each course worked well, the whole menu was just very well thought out.  The two guys that run/own this place were hospitable, funny, knowledgeable and passionate about their food and wine which made the whole experience really special.","50"

The food was delicious, the wines perfect complements. Service was more than impeccable with every dish explained in detail. A great place to dine.","50"

"Morten B","Copenhagen is a modern city with plenty of offerings for the travelling foodie. As can be expected, the inner city has it´s share of tourist traps. Krebsegaarden is in a class of its own, and a perfect place to wind down and enjoy a break from the noise and quick city pace. You feel welcome from the moment you set foot inside. The dining room is small, intimate and as warm in atmosphere as it is in color. Here´s eye contact and attention to detail all the way, from the owners. No chewing gum chewing un-interested part time personell – but proud professional restauranteurs. It is a rare find in Copenhagen, especially at this price point. Krebsegaarden is not expensive, and certainly an exceptional value for money. The menu change according to season, and instead of impressing with foams and tall presentations – the limited number of dishes are celebrations of high quality ingredients, clean tastes and brilliant pairings. Every dish is served with genuine pride – and rightfully so. This is good, honest cooking.   If you are tired of moving around on your seat, battling for a waiter´s attention, you´ll love Krebsegaarden. A nod, a look, a raised pinky, and your waiter is with you – just like every good restaurant should operate, but few actually offer.   Without hesitation – Krebsegaarden is highly recommended. If you want exceptional service, good food and value for money – a cannot think of a better choice in our capitol. Everything is small.... the restaurant, the menu and the wine list. But every single item is high quality and carefully chosen. Good job!","50"
"charlottep293","Was very impressed with the level of attention from the staff. The chef even comes out to explain the menu to you and they are always on hand for questions. The flavours of the food were incredible but just about the right portion size. Quite expensive but good value for Copenhagen and very niche food!

And the plates tasted delicious! The dinner was perfect, and we highly appreciated the touch from our waiter who offered my boyfriend his dessert. This made our time in Copenhagen a really intimate and special one. We will come back for sure!","50"
"mand282","I booked here as it was a special birthday and I was with 4 very foodie friends, all with quite different tastes. Although the menu isn't extensive (its pretty fishy) what it does have is excellent. The bread along is worth a visit! Matt(ias) the owner/manager is a pretty strong character, a bit like marmite, he's pretty loud. I thought he was great. They introduced the food and listened to your preferences, although if they thought you were wrong in a choice of wine they weren't shy to tell you! The Cheese Board was one of the best I've had, 20 small chunks of gorgeousness. Its a lovely intimate size and it was a fab meal. I wouldn't hesitate to go again when I'm in Copehagen.","50"
"AndreaQ123","From the moment we arrived we were treated like valued customers. The food was simply stunning, every mouthful a delight, from the malted homemade bread to the last morsel of the white chocolate fromage dessert with the hint of mint & rye bread crumbles. The menu isn't extensive, but we still had trouble choosing between the options since they all sounded heavenly, but my fish soup was the best I have ever tasted, (smooth, creamy and beautifully balanced), my husband's crayfish salad was divine & cooked to perfection. I then had the grey mullet, husband had the lamb - and the mashed potato was as good as Mats had said it was. Desserts were also sublime & the suggested wine pairings worked really well. All in all this was faultless cooking, with attentive, informed & charming service delivered in an informal & engaging atmosphere. As an experience in dining, this was superb; I wish it was possible to experience this level of expertise every time we eat out!","50"

"MaggieW900","We had the tasting menu with wine flight and can honestly say that every mouthful was superb - I wiped every plate with the delicious bread as I couldn't bear to leave a drop of sauce.

"Adam L","This is a delightfully bijoux restaurant offering a high quality and lovingly prepared menu.   A real highlight for my wife and I was the involvement of the head chef. He firstly came and explained the whole menu to us and then when each dish was served he came and told us how the meal was prepared and the ingredients used. We felt this really helped us appreciate the food more.   We also had some special dietary requirements which he was happy to cater for.   We would defiantly recommend this restaurant. It’s also best you make a reservation in advance of your trip as it gets booked up quickly.","50"
"lordandlady","Went here for a meal on a weekend break and booked due to the high ranking. I wasnt disappointed and we were amused and charmed by the service.

It's like your their guest for the evening in their home.","50"
"Chris R","With such a high rating on Trip Advisor I needed to find out was it really that great? It was great and then some...!  It's not a huge restaurant which leads to its charm and the food is truly exceptional. One of the owners Carsten, who is also one of the chefs, is simply incredibly passionate about his food and describes it in ways that I have never experienced before. It is like watching a master at work describe his craft. I've never had each dish described in the way that he did it and the taste was incredible. All the wine pairings were truly excellent.  We went for the tasting menu along with the wine menu, if you want a treat then this a first class experience that you would pay double for in some of the other more famous restaurants. It's not just the food it is simply the whole experience that was so memorable and we will definitely be returning.","50"

Descriptors of each course were given by Mats or Carsten, who are clearly committed to their cuisine, and to providing such service to make the whole evening one to cherish. There was no sense of being rushed to finish up and leave. We ended up chatting to people at next table, and Mats and Carsten as they served up at other tables. That was last week: I am about to see if I can book for week after next.","50"

The wines were to die for and the service was outstanding.   I didn't know what to expect but it was beyond question one of the best experiences I have ever had in a restaurant.   Carsten - UP THE SPURS! ;)","50"
"kennethChk","Our family of three thoroughly enjoyed our dinner there including being impressed by the larger than life character of Mats the owner. The home made sausages were particularly delicious. However, we were slightly misled by our guide book about tipping is optional and not generally expected. I added another 6% to the bill which worked fine in Paris, our previous destination. This did not go down well with the waiter who processed my payment. His face darkened noticeably and he did not utter a word as he finished my credit card payment. I can hardly remember any restaurant where I did not get a 'thank you' no matter how routine and Krebsegaarden was one. Looking back, the fact that almost everyone around our table were tourists explains how they reacted to a 6% tip. Spoiled by American tipping etiquette probably. I would still recommend it if you like over the top service and is willing to follow up with a big tip.","30"
"Federico V","I could have not ask for a better meal. I had the four course meal and that was plenty. They also have the best selection of wine. I would not think twice about coming back to eat there again. It is not cheap (around $100 USD per person) but totally worth every penny.","50"

We didn't want to leave and will definitely go back. Excellent food, excellent wine and excellent atmosphere.","50"
"Ffrequentflyer","Certainly there is a personal touch here but not necessarily what you may want. The two main guys could be considered friendly and warm and humorous; or loud, lecturing and intrusive! The food could be well researched, well described and balanced with fresh ingredients, or fairly unimaginative, unadventurous and not a long way from what you might achieve yourself at home (although not including the home made sausages!) We couldn't get the link between the art and the food too easily, but had endured enough extraneous chat that we had lost the will to ask!  Almost exclusively the diners were tourists, and from west of the Atlantic, and they seemed to like the schmooze, a little too sugary and overfamiliar for us perhaps.  Perfectly pleasant and not bad value for Copenhagen but altogether underwhelming.","30"

The staff is caring and passionate. We've never seen anything like them. They LOVE what they do and it shows. Every dish was passionately described with excitement, joy and pride. Mad, the head chef and owner, personally handles table service. We were there for almost three hours and we felt like they didn't want us to leave. When it was finally time to say goodbye, it was with hugs and good wishes at the doorway. We thought he was actually tearing up, Mad was so passionate.

Choice of 3 Starters, 3 mains and 3 desserts but we went for the taster menu. Each course was explained along with wine by Mats or Carsten. Each dish was exquisite with each of us being lost for words on different dishes. Favourites being the Crayfish, Bacalao, Veal and redfish. They even got me to eat food I wouldn't normally eat. It is well worth the effort to search out and book this restaurant. Small but perfectly formed. It's spoilt us, best bithday meal ever.","50"

"Cinnamon009","Another friend's recommendation and I was hesitant as the menu was limited. But we are all foodies so came and tried the six course tasting menu - which is basically a small portion of all starters and mains on the menu. Also had a flight of wines. The whole thing was amazing. I would definitely recommend the tasting menu as some of the options I would not have chosen were my favourites. Matts is very enthusiastic about the food and the wine. We were a somewhat lively female party and I liked that it wasn't too stuffy or formal. I apologise if you were a couple in at the same time looking for a quiet evening out!  Overall the cost for the six course tasting and wines and an additional pudding with sweet wine was £95 each. Which is cheap compared to London where I live for a comparative experience.","50"

It's a lot of food, so I didn't have room for dessert. It's a small, charming restaurant, and if you want a table you have to book in advance, like a week.","40"
"666denisd","Excellent resturant. The Crayfish salad was light and fruity perfect for summer dining. The Bacalao was deep and rich like a braised Sunday dinner. I had the 14 piece cheese plate and 3 wine menu which is too much for one. I'd consider the small cheese plate and a glass of wine. Matt and Carsten are friendly and informative (they do like to entertain ). It is a small, intimate room. We met a nice couple from New York. We spent 4 hours at the restaurant which was too long but we lingered and the service was steady. It was expensive but worth the experience. An excellent dinner I highly recommend.","50"

Mats and Carson (as other reviewers have noted) are terrific and friendly hosts who explain all of the wonders of the food and wine. The menu changes seasonally and there are sufficient choices for all courses to satisfy most diners. The wine pairing suggested by Mats worked very well with the courses we selected. The setting is small, but charming. And all of the other diners seemed to be enjoying the experience as well. Krebsegaarden deserves its TripAdvisor ranking.","50"
"Jon R","Everyone raves about this restaurant. Yes.....the staff and the service are second to none; their friendly engagement shows a real passion for their restaurant and you, the customer. Don't be put off by the price....compared to other eating establishments in Copenhagen, it is no dearer than anywhere else. The atmosphere is very relaxed & the standard of the food is very high. However, being told how much effort has been made in producing the dishes and how they have arrived at your table does not mean it is all wonderful. Some of the dishes have truly delicate flavours, especially the guinea fowl. But the creamy mussel soup is so intense & the tomato based sauce on the bacalao can be overpowering on the fish. I am sure everyone will enjoy their experience here but it's not a 'given' as a must return to restaurant.","40"

The fish dishes were so good--I'm still dreaming about the mussel soup--so tasty I wanted to lick the plate. Don't get me started on the chocolate dessert--a puffy cake-like texture with such a rich taste!","50"
"cofernuss","We had a truly exceptional meal tonight at Krebsegaarden. While we consider ourselves reasonably sophisticated eaters from NYC, we don't particularly like overly pretentious food. I had worried in advance that this was what we'd be served given the few options we expected on the menu. Those worries turned out to be entirely unfounded. We split 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts, along with wine pairings for all, and everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, was simply delicious. The dishes were complex without being distractingly so. The flavors popped. The presentation was flawless. Ditto for the service. Props to Karsten, ""our guy"", and Mats, the owner. $200 USD total for a truly amazing meal with plenty of wine. Genuinely one of the best meals I've ever had. Bravo.  If you are in Copenhagen, come here. You won't regret it.","50"

Anywhere! We were encouraged to do the tasting and it was exquisite. The wine pairing took it to another level and combined with the wit, charm, energy and enthusiasm of Mats and Carsten, we were bowled over. We had another reservation at Geist which we cancelled and came for a second dinner at Krebesgaarden the night before we all flew back to the U.S. AND IT WAS JUST AS GREAT. Our party of seven was in the basement this time which gave us a ""private space"". Absolutely wonderful!!!!","50"
"Sardanapale","This restaurant was the gastronomical highlight of our trip to Copenhagen. We decided to splurge and went for the tasting menu with paired wine. The price may sound a bit steep (£150, or 200 euros, for two) but I would recommend this formula: every dish melted in the mouth and was perfectly complemented by the accompanying wine (which came in generous quantities - and in fact a couple may consider ordering a single wine menu if one of the two is a light drinker). We were made to feel most welcome by the colourful owner, who regaled us with running commentaries on the ingredients and the preparation. If would be a shame to travel to Copenhagen and miss such a treat.","50"
"ManthosK","Excellent and friendly service (they were very patient with one of my co-diners was nearly an hour late) with an obvious passion for and knowledge of the food they serve.

The staff is super friendly, and has excellent wine knowledge and recommendations. In total, I think we payed around 700 DKK per person and we all had the set menu with the wine pairing, and coffee.

The attention to detail, the personal touch that the chef and waiters give to each and every table; there's not a single bad thing I can say about this restaurant. Each course is explained to you as it comes out, which makes you feel like you're sitting in the kitchen with the chef while he's cooking versus in a fancy restaurant.

"bethcrockatt","Okay, so it's true to say, some people do not like a performance with their dinner. But this is exactly what Krebsegaarden supplies. The food is centre stage with Mats (the owner) confidentially and passionately explaining why it should be. I personally loved it, having worked in hospitality a long time ago and now moved on the other things, I relish the chance to talk food with someone who lives and breathes it.  We opted for the tasting menu with pairing wines (2x starters, 2x mains and Danish cheeseboard to share) and were not disappointed in the slightest.   It's true what they say, the menu options are small, but why must they be any bigger when the choices that are on there are so beautifully thought out and considered.   My boyfriend and I had a fabulous time at this restaurant, and yes, we were there for the entire evening (take your time, as there is only ever one sitting and it will help to do the food the justice it deserves!). As and when I return to Copenhagen (which I evidentially will) then I will make sure I book this restaurant up again as I am still dreaming about the Danish Blue and wine and will be for some time I feel.","50"
"Ericabo7","I booked a reservation for this place about a month in advanced based on tripadvisor reviews (at the time it was about 5 down the list, now it's number 1) and couldn't have been more pleased. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings and everything was amazing, from the service, to the presentation, to the taste. It was Greek themed cuisine to go with what was showing in the Gallery and even though I don't typically eat Greek food, I ate everything I was served. So much love goes into the preparation and it's evident how passionate Matts and Carsten are. It's both upscale and extremely comfortable. In my own opinion, perfect! I thought it was very reasonable as well, under $200 for everything. Well worth it!","50"

"fru_sorteravn","I booked this restaurant on the basis of the excellent TA reviews, however I was not as impressed by the cuisine as the other reviewers I'm afraid. The restaurant is very nice and cosy and the staff are very welcoming. The menu is limited which I knew beforehand, and with such a small menu, I expected the dishes to be absolutely excellent. My starter of lumpfish roe and crispy chicken skin was very nice but not exceptional. The main dish of plaice was also very nice, but again, not exceptional. The cheese board consisted of many small pieces of local cheeses, some were memorable but most of the blue cheeses all tasted like Danablu. The star of the cheese tasting was the wine pairing, the Maury and the semillon were excellent wines. My dessert of creme caramel was also very nice. We had problems choosing a wine from the list. Wines from Germany and Austria are not top of the list for us, we chose a chardonnay from the US which turned out to be be medium dry.  The service was extremely slow. We were in the restaurant for almost 4 hours. This is because each and every dish's preparation is explained in intricate detail. I am very interested in cooking and ingredients but even for me, I felt it was too much. If you do that for every guest and every dish, service takes a very long time. I prefer less intrusive service. But the other guests seem to love this. The waiter/entertainer(?) was very passionate about the restaurant and the food, it was just not my style however. I'm not really sure why there is such a high rating. I can only imagine it is because mostly tourists go, there were no locals at all, so perhaps for a first time visitor to Copenhagen this might be impressive. But as I have been numerous times and have eaten in some truly excellent and innovative restaurants in Copenhagen, I expected more, sorry.","30"

"539jog","A fabulous restaurant. I found it on TripAdvisor and took a chance turning up without a booking on a Tuesday night. Luckily there was a table free, but the restaurant is very small so we were lucky. The food was epic. I can honestly say it was the tastiest Tenderloin I have had in a long time. The cheeseboard was an experience and for all cheese lovers - its a must. The restaurant is small, three guys run the place and make everyone feel very welcome. I can thoroughly recommend this place.","50"
"JohnK584","Wow! What an amazing evening and the highlight of our stay in Copenhagen. A happy buzzy atmosphere accompanied by sublime food and first class service from Mats and the team. The crayfish salad was perfection, the ox superb, so much so that we had to share the cheese (but not the accompanying wines which we both enjoyed!). You have to do this to finish off your meal...15 delicious Danish cheeses, each with their own story, so descriptively described by Mats. Perfection. No more to say...","50"
"i_m_tours","My wife and I ate here on our recent city break in Copenhagen.  This was not a case of simply going out to a restaurant for something to eat but a fantastic dining experience which will live long in our memory.  We were warmly welcomed by the co-owners (almost as if we were regulars) and the menu explained to us. After some deliberation we decided to opt for a 5 course tasting menu with matching wines and what a good choice it proved to be. Every course and matching wine was fully explained and each pairing was simply perfect. Highlights for us were the crayfish salad and the beef tenderloin.  The food and wine were enhanced by the amazing service provided by the co-owners who clearly have a real passion for what they do and set out to ensure that their patrons have an unforgettable dining experience.  Lastly, the total cost for two was DKK1400 including coffee which we felt was very reasonable and a lot less than a similar meal would cost in the UK.  We cannot recommend Krebsegaarden highly enough.","50"
"oonitoon","One of the best meals we have had anywhere and we have been lucky to travel a lot so have eaten in amazing places.  Firstly Matt and his team are amazing, we were late as we got lost but they immediately put us at ease. After a short discussion we decided to have a tasting menu with wines. The wines chosen were just great. Wines I would not have considered trying and one was better than the other. The plaice dish was exquisite - delicate with stunning flavours - and the beef dish was simply outstanding. The best dish we have eaten in ages. You can tell that the best of ingredients are sourced here. The whole package here is perfect. The small restaurant is intimate, the service just fantastic, the food amazing. This is a must visit for any foodie person visiting Copenhagen. We will return to this fantastic city just to have dinner in this little gem of a restaurant again.","50"

"Lorie L","Sweet little restaurant with a lovely decor. Decor matches the art in the gallery behind the restaurant and the menu look and content changes to reflect the art. The staff knows its wines and suggested good pairings for each dish. Tiny menu, which we liked, but others may find limiting. The food was superb!","50"
"37SteveD37","Now this is a restaurant experience. Really delicious, innovative food, splendid wine, fabulous cosy atmosphere & the friendliest service. The menu is small, 2-3 dishes per course and there's an option to create your own tasting menu from it, which we did, of 5 dishes. We also opted for the wine pairings which turned out to be another splendid decision as the wines were delicious and varied. The 2 starters we tried, lumpfish roe & roasted chicken skin & the house crayfish salad were both gorgeous. The 2 mains were even better, a stunning beef tenderloin (with an unexpected opportunity to find out about burning love) and the dish of the night - the house bacalao, which goes down as one of my favourite dishes ever and nothing like any bacalao I've ever had. Even the dessert was a great one too, on paper not much, marinated pear with various bits & pieces, but spot on in the mouth in terms of tastes & textures. The chaps who serve the food clearly very much love what they do, making everyone very welcome and I can't believe anyone could leave here not having had a wonderful time.","50"

"Marnie R","My husband and I love to book one highly rated restaurant for dinner every time we go abroad and this was our choice for Copenhagen. We were not disappointed as the service, atmosphere and food here was second to none. The venue itself had a very understated, homy feel but still was able to cater for a large groups as well as smaller intimate groups very well.  The menu was very short and only offered a few options for each course which is always a bonus as you can expect the high quality food when there is limited choice. We both had the soup for starter which was delicious - I could have had three more bowls and skipped the main! But luckily I didnt because we had slow cooked pork belly and it was divine. My only gripe was it was a little salty but that didn't take away from how good the food was.   Much to my delight there was an unlimited supply of fresh bread and butter at every course. But since I ate so much of it neither of us had a large dessert and instead opted to share the petit four chocolates which were as we expected - delicious.   We were served by the owner of the restaurant himself and an other one of the wait staff who was equally charming. I am pretty fussy when it comes to wine only really liking sweet or fruity kinds and they both chose a lovely white for my main and a delicious red dessert wine. They even insisted I take a picture of the wine labels when I asked. It's very rare as I find most people are reluctant to do this.  All in all, I would highly recommend this resturant to any visiting friends and family to Copenhagen. If you are after unpretentious fine dining you won't want to miss this. I completely understand why it is rated #1 on Trip Advisor and hope to visit again one day.","50"
"eggpie2906","We booked several months in advance for a table on Valentine's Day - and were delighted to find that the restaurant didn't have a special (aka overpriced!) menu or cheesy decorations, but seemed to be running just as it would on any other Saturday evening. The tables weren't too close, and the staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive - so they managed to create a lovely, intimate atmosphere while giving all the guests their own space. The food was astonishingly good - each course was more delightful and surprising than the last, rounding off with the tour de force cheeseboard. We sampled 15 local cheeses, each introduced by the hilarious and knowledgable chef. Wonderful.  We chose the taster menu, and had five courses: one starter, a taster of all three mains, and the cheese. Our eyes were too big for our bellies on this occasion, as the tasting portions were very generous. I'd recommend ordering a bit less but saving room for the cheeseboard.  The final surprise was the bill - I didn't see it, but I could see that my boyfriend was expecting it to be a LOT more expensive than it was. So, can't really recommend this restaurant high enough and we hope to visit again one day.","50"

The chef was very knowledgable with the food and wine, if you are not sure of what to order and which wine to pair with, you can leave the decision to him and just be amazed. The bill came up to be very reasonable as per Danish standard. If you are not a big eater, you can always opt for the ""small"" for your main course, as I couldn't even finish half of my plate even though they are very delicious.","50"

The staff are amazing passionate about their food and drink. You just have to order the cheese board with accompanied wines - it is awesome. Many of the cheeses have been “customised” by the staff so are totally unique. Again, all brilliantly explained by the staff. We can’t wait to return one day – when we do we promise we’ll bring one of our local award winning cheeses for you to try in return!","50"

"Scott L","We got in on a last minute booking, and based on the size of the place it would be worth booking in advance.  The food has a great home style feel to it, being sufficiently sophisticates without being pretentious. We had the 5 course tasting with matching wine, which was plenty of food for dinner. Wine pours were generous. If you have ever been to Fou de fafa in Avignon, France (which is also excellent) I think you'll find this to be a comparable experience in terms of the food.  The owners are really friendly guys, with Mats providing atmosphere with anecdotes and 'dad jokes', whereas Carson was a bit quieter but still very friendly. Reading other reviews it seems as though people were expecting a stuffy fine dining experience, and so they were disappointed by the banter. Consequently if all you want to hear is the clinking of cutlery and the haughty snorts of luxury car owners then perhaps you should go elsewhere. Otherwise take advantage of their friendly attitude and obvious passion for what they do!  I was going to give them 4 stars but I raised it to 5 simply because of the value. When we got the bill it was less than half what I expected it to be! It was simply excellent value for the standard of food and wine given Copenhagen's prices and comparable restaurants.","50"

He made food suggestions and explained what was being served without being too overbearing. Four courses with wine pairings came to about $150CAD per person. In my opinion good value for what we received. One word of caution is be sure to make a reservation as they fill up about 2 weeks in advance and they turn away walk-ins.","50"
"Ketil T","The menues are inspired by the art exihibition in the same house. The owners wo are running the restaurant talk to you about what you should eat, and even how much (i.e. just want to taste or love that can I have a large portion) and recommend the right wine by the glass as a package in the same way - it just was a total delight. Beware - the place is popular, but being on the waiting list paid off. With only 10 table or so and only one seating per night the focus is on the customers and it was huge fun to experience that. I am looking forward to next time.","50"

Thanks guys","50"
"Rockin777","If you can't quite stretch to Noma, or would rather go somewhere a little more down to earth then this is spot for you.  Mats the owner is superb, his passion for food and wine is infectious and from the moment you sit down you're made to feel welcome and special. The wine selection is superb and Mats makes great recommendations to go with each course, I discovered a couple of great wines at his suggestion which blended perfectly with the food.  The food was great, the menu changes frequently to match the art on display, but I can confidently say that based on our meal whatever you have will hit the spot.   It's also great value, not the cheapest but for what you get it's amazing and stacks up very well against less adventurous chain restaurants or ""big name"" establishments you could visit instead.  One tip, do book in advance, we booked about 6 weeks ahead of time and throughout our evening there Mats was having to politely turn people who had not booked away.","50"
"Azatoth","This is a really nice small restaurant. Great food and good wines. But what makes this place special is the friendly Norwegian guys running the place. It is not a gourmet-restaurant like NOMA, Geranium etc. and there are after my opinion better restaurants in Copenhagen, but the atmosphere here cannot be beaten and the prices are a lot lower than you would expect. The tasting menu is a good choice if you want to try different courses. You do not have to take the full wine-menu. The wines from the menu is not more expensive if you buy them by the glass.","50"

It was one of the two best dinners we had on the trip (the other bring 1877 in Bergen), one of the best values for the money, and certainly the most unique.   After a few minutes of discussion with Mats, the more jovial of the two proprietors, we decided to just put ourselves in his hands for both food and wine. The result was a top notch meal, well-matched wines, and lots of friendly banter with our host, who has a decidedly edgy sense of humor.  My suggestion is to do as we did. You won't be disappointed.","50"

"paulreid23","My wife and I had our last meal in Copenhagen here before flying back home to Australia and we couldn't have made a better choice. Those on TA who give it a wrap are spot on.  A small but well chosen menu, reasonably priced for Copenhagen, and a wine list the host is happy to advise on and match with your budget and food choice. A very small restaurant but that enables them to maintain the quality. The food is old school cordon bleu, a welcome relief from the pretentious Nordic froth that seems to be all the rage. Just fresh ingredients carefully prepared by kitchen professionals. The atmosphere is very friendly and conducive to what the Danes call 'hygge'.  No 'too cool for school' pony-tailed waiters, more like a family dinner. Just make sure you book.","50"
"Caroline0190","Went here for my boyfriend's birthday on Saturday night. Chose it on both reviews and also on price, and as per other reviewers comments, this is an excellent restaurant at a fraction of the price of other high end Copenhagen restaurants. The food we had was lovely - I had the cheese tart to start and then the veal. Both portions of a decent size and lovely fresh flavours. The owner took the time to discuss the different wine options with us, my boyfriend prefers a lighter red whilst I prefer a heavier one, so it was agreed that rather than our usual compromising on a bottle, that we would drink wine that the owner had recommended to us by the glass. Good choices! The service was fantastic, both owners very knowledgeable and they really took the time to talk us through the menu. We were actually the last 2 in the restaurant and upon finding out that it was my boyfriends birthday, they poured him some different spirits to try on the house. All in all, a fantastic experience and my boyfriend said that it was a highly enjoyable birthday (well done me!)  PS...thanks to the owners for the suggestion of the rum club for drinks afterwards (2 doors down). Good suggestion, those cocktails were lethal (but lovely) so I am blaming them for the sore head I had the next day! :)","50"
"madwax","I visited the restaurant with my wife last night to celebrate my birthday. I really enjoyed the restaurant - especially the atmosphere and the two chefs, who really make it unique. I have been to several fine dining restaurants both in Copenhagen (2x Noma, Geranium etc), Jiro in Tokyo etc so I have something to compare with.   I would say that the food is not as great or exquisite as at Noma - but the overall experience matches it, especially when considered value for money. The food is still excellent and would stack up and beat most of every other restaurants hands down.   To make a comparison, we ate the 7-course tasting menu, with the wine pairing and accepted all the chefs recommendations. The total price was approx 2 000 DKK for both of us (compared to Noma or geranium where you easily pay 2 000 DKK per person). We even got three(!) glasses of wine to the cheese dessert - which in it self is worth a visit.   I really appreciated that the chefs made an effort to speak with Swedish words since even though being neighboring countries, it is difficult to understand fast-talking danes. It's personal, they serve excellent food and I would actually recommend it any day.","50"
"HillsCA","Second visit in 5 years. Highly rated Tripadvisor then, highly rated now. The two Norwegian owners exude ""confidence."" On a side street, small, high quality, limited menu, small portions, ""interesting"" pairing of ingredients. Appetizers 95 DKK, main about 225. Two glasses of wine later, about 510 per person. Good experience? Yes. Great cuisine? Maybe not as great as the owners think.","40"

My only suggestion is to take your time & enjoy.","50"
"MattC415","Like many of the others who have given positive reviews (and thus the top rating), we were drawn here because we wanted a top quality dining experience that wasn't as obnoxiously priced as the top Michelin locales such as Noma. We were not disappointed. We went on a Tuesday evening in late August and had a later seating so by the time we were in the second half of our meal we were among the last few tables -- which just made it better because we got that much more time to chat with the chef.   We are fortunate to live in San Francisco and have had many top-quality meals, and the six course wine pairing we had here was among the best. A solid variety of different foods based on the art in the adjacent gallery, and they all tied together nicely.  Not much more to say that hasn't already been said here except to reiterate it is a really good experience worth making the visit to enjoy for yourself. Another strong recommendation!","50"

"Honigkuchen","Thanks to the glowing Trip Advisor reviews, my partner booked the two of us and three other adults with whom we were travelling into this restaurant during a recent visit to Copenhagen. We arrived with high expectations and I am glad to say they were exceeded - by a mile. The restaurant itself is small and homely with seven-or-so tables. We were a little early but were immediately greeted very warmly and shown to our table. Although the menu was limited (three courses with three to four choices each), the decision as to what to eat was not all that easy as everything sounded mouthwateringly good. Our hosts (owners/operators Mats and Carsten) were happy to give recommendations and, once we had all decided Mats offered to match wines to all three courses, an offer we happily accepted. The food was amazing, including the homemade bread that kept appearing, and the wine matches were outstanding. Both Mats and Carsten talked to us about the food and wine they set in front of us, something that I really appreciated. Mats is clearly the more outgoing of the two and we had some very interesting conversations that went well beyond the food and wine on the table. While we very much enjoyed this interactive dinner, it is not for everyone and something to be aware of before making a booking. After we had finished desert, the two whiskey enthusiasts at our table were treated to a tasting of a couple of rather unique whiskeys, a tasting they very much enjoyed. While this is not the cheapest restaurant we have ever been to, it is certainly not as expensive as we expected and in my opinion great value for the incredibly wonderful all-round experience. Mats' and Carsten's passion is clear in every aspect of their venture and it was a pleasure to enjoy their well thought-out food-creations. We'd happily return to Restaurant Krebsegaarden.","50"
"495samanthaa","My husband and I had a wonderful experience at Krebsegaarden where the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is friendly in a ""warm, ""welcome home"" kinda way. Mats and his colleagues made sure to notice all of the details from the moment we arrived. We had the tasting menu paired with selected wines. My favorite dish of the night was minestrone soup paired with a 2011 Côtes du Rhône white called Laurus. The three different types of beans, ham and bacon, chicken broth and delicate delicious herbs and spices was so light and it paired perfectly with the soup; I savored every bit! I really enjoyed the Norwegian happy birthday song that Mats and a neighboring table sang for me! If you have a chance definitely have dinner at Krebsegaarden in Copenhagen, I know that when we visit Copenhagen again, Krebsegaarden will be on our to do list.","50"
"xplizt","Our meal at Restaurant Krebsegaarden was the best meal I have ever eaten in any restaurant, full stop. Mats and Carsten were incredible hosts, happy to engage in conversation and discuss the food and drinks with us. We let ourselves be guided by Mats as to what wines to match with the food, and the results were amazing. I then had a most interesting conversation with him regarding Merchant Spirits, and he recommended several whiskies that were among the best I've ever tasted, along with a Rum for another member of our group that she found to be delicious. I cannot recommend this place highly enough - a must if you are visiting Copenhagen! Remember to book well in advance though to ensure you get a table :)","50"
"Ronica S","We decided on Krebsegaarden for our friend's birthday dinner based on the reviews on Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed. Carsten the chef was very helpful choosing dishes, Mats equally with the wine. The restaurant is cozy and friendly, the food fantastic, and the service impeccable. We started with a wonderful Grand Cru champagne recommended by Carsten to begin the celebration. Then we had the five course tasting menu with wine pairings. All four of us, without exception had an experience to remember. The attention to detail, and their enthusiasm and knowledge of the dishes and ingredients is commendable.

The excellent service, food and quaint ambiance makes this one of the best restaurants experiences we've both have experienced.","50"
"roadfill","This was one of the overall best dining experiences we have ever had in terms of both food and service. Careful attention to detail is given to each dish with fresh ingredients, a delicate balance of textures, sweet and salty flavours. The wine matching was also done with flair. We tried just three dishes; the pickled radish with goat cheese cream, the lamb and the red fish. All were excellent in execution and taste and we wish our appetites could have stretched further. We highly recommend this restaurant.","50"
"kbemje","Loved this little gourmet restaurant where we had the 5 course tasting menu. We let Matts pick our dishes and enjoyed each one. They are not large portions but adequate enough to have a great taste. We did. Of do the wine pairings since we had jet lag or we would have crashed into our food. Service was friendly and such a great where Matts explained the preparing of each dish which was full of various spices and tiny cut veggies. I adored the rack of lamb and the crayfish appetizer. I had one glass of Pinto Grigio and Joe had two glasses of blood orange juice. The other people near us raved about the wine pairings. The cost was about $ 163 plus 5% tip which is customary in Copenhagen which we asked Matts. Great not to be missed if you want a taste of Great Dane cooking.","50"

"anthonyc34","Enjoyed the food in this unusually small restaurant. The experience was not as overwhelmingly good as we had been led to believe from the majority of views on Facebook.

"Batonwaver","I reserved this place months in advance of our trip to Europe based on TA's top rating for Copenhagen.  It lived up to the previous ratings. Mats, the owner, meets you at the front door and takes you through the whole dining experience. Listen to the master if you have the opportunity to dine at this excellent restaurant.   The menu has only two or three items per course, but they are perfectly executed with full narration and wine parings if you wish.  He even took the time to explain how to pour beer in the proper glass even though I had not ordered beer. I had seen him pour it at another table and he caught my interest in the glass he was using.  This is a great experience and well worth the price. There are only a few tables so book far in advance. Make sure you reply to the email request for reservation confirmation when you receive it.  We saw a few people turned away from the door tonight for not following proper procedure.  Don't miss this spot in Copenhagen. ","50"

"doco57","On our first visit to Copenhagen we were told we had to eat at Nomas. a few months agao we actually had the chance to get a reservation. However, after reading reviews some suggested that while its great- some chefs have left and opened alternative spots that are equal in quality. Krebsgaarden was one. So we decided to dine there. It is a small charming restaurant.. The chef /waiters are great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. However, even as they described the complex way in whcih tehy prepared the food. It simply was not memorable dining. Don't get me wrong it was very good. Yet not much better than many ""very good"" places I have eaten around the world. The food was simply not world class. The expected additions such as a chefs appietizer or intemezzo were non existant. Dessert though ( caramel) was fantastic. So I blame myself abit for such high expectations and then being let down. Very good spot but not worth the prices and certainly not world class.","40"

We had the crayfish salad which was exquisite, the lemon sole and veal were both delicious and the cheese board was a complete delight.   But best of all, the service from the waiter and the owner (I think - unfortunately we forgot to get his name) was exemplary. They clearly know their food and wine - and better than that, the origins of both (we were fascinated by the background of each of the 12 cheeses on the cheese board!).  Total bill came up to about £90 including drinks excluding tips - very reasonable we felt for the experience. Overall highly recommended!","50"
"Jkhoo1","A small and unassuming restaurant that served up fastastic food. Like a lot of European restaurants where there was novel and innovative mix of ingredients, this restaurant did it very well. The tasting plates served up larger portions than normal degustation dinners, we were full by the finish. The meal was accompanied with a bold full body Spanish red from the Toro region at the toung waiter's recommendation. A great meal.....","50"
"5700Voss","Copenhagen is one of my favorite destinations and I visited the city the second weekend of May with my wife. There are many nice restaurants to chose from, but we are very happy that we selected Restaurant Krebsegaarden. The staff is very friendly, and they have a great commitment and knowhow about the food and the wine they are serving. The restaurant is small and cosy, and perfect for a romantic dinner. As a starter i had the crayfish salad, and the taste was very good, unlike any salad I have tasted before. My choice for main course was the filet og veal, another winner. And since creme caramel is one of dessert favorites, the choice was easy. All in all a perfect dinner, including matching wines, recommended by the staff. I will be back!","50"
"mrs7777","Surprisingly good meal in a pleasant environment. Excellent service. We asked the waiter to select the wine per dish and he did an great job. The menu is quite small but I think there is always something good for everyone. Menu changes monthly so watch out if you plan to pre-select something from the menu on the internet. In my case the menu had just changed (no problem though). Will try to go back here when visiting Copenhagen again.","40"

Would highly recommend especially if you like someone assisting you in your choice of wines for each course.","40"

They are flexible with the menu and allow you to try mains as appetisers and vice versa. The food burst with flavour. We assumed there were additional chefs in the kitchen but towards the end of night we realised it was the two owners waiting and cooking. Their hard work and passion is pivotal to the success of the restaurant. Thoroughly enjoyed it!","50"
"TomB_UK","The food was variable, none of it bad, but some of the food combinations didn't quite do it for us and didn't live up to the expectations built by previous reviews on trip advisor. Also very limited choice, and even though that is often a good approach, in this case it was just a bit too narrow.   The owner does like a chat and certainly gets involved. No doubt many people really welcome this (as all the good reviews demonstrate) but we found it a bit too much. Perhaps we were just not in the right mood.  Three might be a bit harsh but for me did not do enough to warrant a four.","30"
"stevedenlewis","As it was our wedding anniversary we wanted a great restaurant for the evening and booked from the UK via the internet the previous week. Having read all the reviews we expected something special and that is what we got. The food was exceptional and the service just as good. The restaurant is a credit to the hard work and commitment of Mats and Carsten who enhanced our experience with their friendliness. I will always remember Mats for our chat about football and even more for his knowledge of Malt Whisky ! I tried one or two and came away with the names of some I must buy in the future. I cannot praise this restaurant high enough. It is fabulous and when you visit Copenhagen give a try you will love it.","50"

They do one seating every evening which is brilliant. Will definitely go again.","50"

With so much riding on it, we were slightly nervous, despite other excellent reviews, but our experience in this lovely restaurant matched up to all the positive comments made by earlier diners. The atmosphere was charming. It's quite small, but there is no sense of tables being crowded together nor were we rushed through our meal. In fact we spent an hour eating our way through the cheese board, having previously been introduced to each cheese and its provenance by Mats. I had the three wines to match the cheeses (fortunately small quantities rather than full glasses!) and that in itself was an experience and an education. A limited menu-but when each dish is perfection, why do you need more?","50"

"Christina2001","We arrived at the restaurant off season and midweek with a reservation - much to the owner's relief. It was very easy to place a reservation online. And I was delighted to have selected this restaurant for my short stay as it was a special experience from start to finish. The staff is very attentive, caring and knowledgeable about their food and drink. There are 3 starters, 3 mains and 3 desserts to choose from - all very appealing. The courses are based on the resident artist (as the restaurant doubles as a gallery downstairs), which is quite novel. We enjoyed all our courses and the wine was amazing. Considering the quality and presentation of the food, it is truly excellent value for less than €10 a starter and €20 for the main. It was a shame we had no room left for the cheese course, as it looked divine and the owner was able to talk others through the large selection with detail and enthusiasm. Highly recommended!","50"
"kathy w","It was our last night in Copenhagen so we wanted to have a special evening and we were certainly not disappointed by our choice of restaurant.

"EmilyGraceM","Me and my partner came for Dinner on Wednesday night, we were only in Copenhagen for three days and wanted to make sure I chose a good restaurant for our short stay and Krebsegaarden did not disappoint! The food was wonderful and you can see all the effort that goes into this restaurant from the food and wine all the way down to the artwork and the way you feel your having dinner in someone's home rather than being waited on. The owner, I believe his name is Mats, had a great chat with us as we were leaving and seems like a wonderful guy - and if he reads this, we did not have dinner on Thursday and we went over to Ruby's early but thankfully I didn't drink four bottles of wine!!  We'll definitely be back!! A truly wonderful evening. Thank You!","50"
"hansmiddelburg","The restaurant doesn't look extremely fancy. In fact it is kind off simple but with very nice art everywhere. The immediate warmth and passion of the staff is wonderful. The way the food and the wines are presented is rarely seen. Staff was really funny and very professional/knowledgable at the same time. We experienced the 5-course tasting menu with matching wines. The food is really extremely good and original and again, presented with passion and knowledge. The wines were also original, outstanding quality from very small vineyards. Also worth mentioning is the prices were very reasonable especially compared to Danish standards. I can understand that this restaurant is being perceived as one of the best in Copenhagen.","50"
"R P","As a non-fish lover, my wife was initially quite concerned about this restaurant because of (what we felt were) extremely limited choices - she wasn't relishing the starters, and would have preferred a chicken dish, rather than her main course choice of lamb. She (like me) was swayed by the spectacularly good reviews on TripAdvisor - and we are so very pleased we came here! Each dish was sublimely cooked and enthusiastically presented by Mats and Carsten and we counted ourselves supremely fortunate to have booked on line, especially as several couples were turned away. These guys are anything but greedy - they could have turned the tables over and/or hurried the diners along - but they preferred to treat everyone as special guests and the atmosphere as well as the food is an absolute credit to them. Our visit was on Valentine's Day and was in every way a very special evening - and we both felt privileged to have been there - and to have met such lovely people. And if you had told my wife that she would be so smitten by beetroot soup for starter and her lamb main course, neither she, nor I would have believed you. We would highly recommend this restaurant above many charging much more.","50"

"axlpaxl","This is THE perfect restaurant.   Me and my girlfriend visited this restaurant about a week ago. We where the first 2 people eating from the 2014 menu. This is an experience we will never forget.  The restaurant feels like the owners livingroom, I loved it. It feels like you invited over for dinner at the owners own house, with great home cooked food to match. The ambience of the place is great, the owner makes you feel so welcome, and it really does not feel like a restaurant.   And the food.. It is perfect. The menu is just what restaurant food is all about. 9 courses (3 starters, 3 mains, 3 desserts) with good wine to match. I always feel like a restaurant with less courses on the menu, is better then a restaurant with a huge menu. Less courses = less frozen and pre-perpared food.   The food was great, we had a main and dessert, and because we decided to share a dessert, the owned decided to make it a little bigger, so it was enough for the both of us, such perfect service.  All in all, the perfect restaurant, pricing is exactly where it should be, service is excellent, and the food even more excellent.   Thank you!","50"

I have to admit the website doesn't inspire too much and I've chosen other restaurants in the past beacuse of that, but I finally got around to trying Krebsegården  ...and I can only echo what so many others have already said: absolutely delicious food (from a simple and limited menu), nice atmosphere and great service from two very knowledgable and attentive Norwegians who shared fascinating details on the provenance of the food and wine.  The cheese platter (11 different cheeses, all from DK) was superb.  And all in very reasonably priced for the quality you get. I will go again!","50"

Dont forget to ask them stories of the many vintage wine and scotch they have on display in the restaurant...they also let us taste some of the lovely scotch on the house.  Will visit here everytime i am in copenhagen!!","50"
"OliverC1967","This was a wonderful find, very close to our hotel. We found the restaurant recommended on Tripadvisor and using their own website arranged our reservation directly with them, and they were very swift to respond. The menu appeared limited, but do not be deceived as the food is prepared from available fresh ingredients and reflects changing seasons. The restaurant was intimate and well attended by patrons yet was not noisy and did not feel crowded. The service was wonderful, very friendly and the chef served each table taking great trouble to explain each dish and his creations. The food was exceptional, the flavours were well balanced and exciting on the palate. Added to which they were visually very impressive making the desire to eat even greater! We will have no hesitation returning to this restaurant, intact we struggled with the decision as to whether to return each night or eat elsewhere.","50"

The restaurant was quiet but had a relaxing atmosphere, the menu was clearly explained as were the portion sizes - we went for small so that we would have room for desert! My daughter had the reindeer pot which was was a heady mix of Gamey flavours with the meat sublimely tender. I had the traditional Xmas cod dish with cod roe ...excellent ,but glad I chose the small portion. We finished with homemade petit four and tea with the bill coming to 679 kr - we didn't have wine which probably kept the price down and felt it was the best value for money meal that we'd had in Copenhagen. A lovely evening with great service,friendly and amusing without being intrusive - would definitely come again!","50"

Matts was away in Norway and we were in the very capable and informative care of Carsten who usually creates all in the kitchen. We both started with seared scallops with Jerusalem artichoke purée and samphire. These were delicate and succulent - heavenly! I then chose Angler fish accompanied by mixed root vegetables and mushrooms. The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavours fed my soul. This was one of the most delicious creations I ever have had.  I opted to round off this wonderful meal with home made chocolate petit fours and was rewarded with jewels of cocoa delight!","50"

This is a restaurant run by people who understand what and enjoyable food experience should be like. We opted to allow the waiter/head chief to choose the wines and he carefully selected a glass for each course to match what we each were eating, which added to the experience. We finished with the Cheese board that should not be missed and this was served with three wines to match the cheeses.","50"

"Vatnemav","We went here for my birthday, two couples. We found all the dishes on the menu as interesting, so Mats, one of the owners and chefs recommended us to take all six dishes, in smaller portions. In addition to this, they served us the perfect wine with each dish. The service was fantastic, the food was excellent, nice prepared and well tasting. Mats used a lot of time on us, presenting the meals and the wine etc. After sitting there many hours, talking, drinking and enjoying ourselves, they sang for me and serviced my ice-cream with a candle on it. Just a perfect restaurant for eating with close friends, family or having a date.  Worth a visit!","50"
"BobandGina","Got to give this FIVE stars. This is a handy place, just north of the main shopping drag. You get to have either 3 or 5 courses, and as is usual in many great places, the menu choice is almost nil. This is certainly no criticism, because they can and do concentrate on great food. Freshness is important here, and that, and floavours, combined with the impressive, friendly, knowledgeable front of house, makes Krebsgaarden a real winner. Copenhagen is expensive, so in that context, prices here are relatively reasonable.","50"
"EastLondonGuy","Copenhagen has some incredible restaurants, but my budget didn't stretch to the likes of 'Noma' unfortunately   So I trusted Tripadvisor for some tips. So glad I did.  It was our anniversary , and was pleased that booking a month ahead we were able to get a table.  Booked by email and they followed up to confirm we were def coming..  Easy to find, just a short walk from a metro station  Quite a small place which gave it an intimate feel, just half a dozen tables.  Mats the owner is a very interesting character , friendly and happy to talk through every aspect of his dishes. We had tasting menu with paired wines.  Came out during and after the meal and told us about himself and the restaurant, the other guy who's name i can't remember (sorry !) was also a great bloke, and we chatted about English football , fellow Spurs fan :)  They only have 1 sitting so were able to relax and chat.  Was pleasantly surprised that the bill was reasonable , even though I was preparing for a typically expensive copenhagen one !  Nice liqueur to send us on our way... Happy to recommend","50"

"NICESTLGUY","I picked this place for a group meal for 11 people. I'm in the US and was able to put together the reservation by email. We settled on a 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and Mats was amazing making sure everyone was comfortable. Even with some picky eaters, everyone loved the dinner and wines. Each course was truly amazing and the service was perfect. If you are trying to pick from all the great restaurants in Copenhagen, pick this one and I hope you have as great of time as we did!!!","50"
"Hildegus","It's a rather small restaurant, with an intimate and relaxed atmosphere. We ordered the set 5 course menu, with wine. The food was very tasty and the wines were lovely. The staff is very dedicated and serviceminded and they made our almost 4 hour meal the very highlight of our stay in Copenhagen. Thank you guys!","50"
"EllieCI","My husband chose this restaurant based on other trip adviser reviews and we were not disappointed. Although the menu was not extensive, all of the dishes sounded excellent. Because of the art exhibition tie-in the food had a Croatian theme. We both had lovely starters and the most perfectly cooked ox tenderloin for main course. We went for the truly incredible cheeseboard to finish - small mouthfuls of thirteen fabulous Danish cheeses, complete with the tasting order and details of each from Mats who is clearly passionate about their food generally and cheese in particular! It was also good to see Chef Carsten getting out and speaking to diners. Service was excellent and food even better. Couldn't recommend highly enough.","50"

Three: Enjoy your evening. Oh, and I like restaurants that offer medium / normal portions. Big plus: Reasonable prices & meals the kids throughoutly enjoyed with organic ingredients & even most of the drinks if not all was organic (aka - no Coka Cola or Fanta for the kids - which was no problem here). Paid a little more than 2000 Danish kroner for three course dinner for four, plus glass of wine for each course for two. Not too bad :)","50"
"ericlokness","Krebsegaarden stole the spotlight as my favorite memory from an amazing weekend in Copenhagen!   A tip - make a reservation as soon as you arrive in Copenhagen either in person or by phone! It is an intimate place and there is no rushing the patrons, so space is incredibly limited. Krebsegaarden is highly regarded and droves of potential customers were turned away during my visit since they didn't plan ahead.   The place is run by two eccentric soccer loving Norwegians with a passion for good food. The menu is inspired by the adjacent gallery but with a Scandinavian twist. While we were there the inspiration was Croatian as the gallery was displaying the work of Viktor Daldon. If you want a taste of Scandinavia cuisine don’t fear as some staples persist through the changing gallery. I highly recommend the bacalao, which is a recipe passed down by the chef’s grandmother. I would also suggest taking the taster-menu as you can try a wide range of delicious dishes, many of which are based on the plentiful fresh fish that are a mainstay of a good Scandinavian diet. To accompany your meal the restaurant attempts to expand your pallet by offering an eclectic range of wines from around the world, we tried wine from New Zealand, Spain and Washington State. If you still haven’t whet you appetite then you should try the crème caramel for dessert followed by a glass of akvavit as a perfect cap to your night. WARNING akvavit was designed for Vikings and is not for the casual drinker!   Krebsegaarden has very reasonable prices by Copenhagen standards. If you’re on a budget then eat sandwiches all week from the supermarket and splurge on one nice meal - that is what we did. Krebsegaarden will not disappoint! This was the best dining experience of my life. Thank you Mats and Carsten!","50"
"Elliot J","I chose this restaurant based on the near unanimous rave reviews on TripAdvisor. I was not disappointed. A small, cozy gem with 10 tables; superb food served at an appropriate pace, excellent wine pairings, and the waiter/chef/owner (Mad) who made it a memorable experience. His description of each preparation merged on poetic -- and the food lived up to it. Ethereal!! Do not miss this place.","50"
"Mart G","There are many accurate reviews already on the site. Thanks to the recommendations my partner and I made a visit and yes the food was good, the wine that we tasted was excellent, the waiters were very helpful, and yes they had many things to say about the food. I always find it impossible to take in the amount of information being given about the food I am about to eat, and something in me was saying, ""okay, fine, but just let me get on with it; maybe I can ask questions later"". In terms of interesting, balanced food, this place is better than many. Worth a visit, but don't go there if you are looking for a picturesque place, or an intimate meal. There were lots of pictures on the wall and in the basement, and the food is themed around the exhibition we are told. I did not really make the connection, mainly perhaps because the food seemed much more appealing, more artistic, than what was on the wall.","40"
"luigiGZ","Small, precious, the menu is perfect, the wines are very well choosen, the people inside very polite. For a special evening, for romantic moments. The menu change upon season as the choice of paintings at the walls. Cheeses are amazing, reservation is needed. Have fun!","50"
"JessicaBN","I've been lucky enough to eat in some of the best restaurants in the world including el bulli, Nomo and in my opinion the best ever Michel Rostang.

From the minute we walked in we were made to feel welcome and this lasted throughout our time here with mat's taking lots of time out to talk to us (I think the fact we are both Man Utd fans helped!). We found it impossible to pick a specific dish from the intriguing menu and instead opted for tasting dishes. We weren't disappointed. Every dish offered something different, with the veal dish being an absolute highlight. Mats revels in his front of house role and Carsten is a truly exceptional chef with a real understanding of flavour combinations and the important of using good ingredients and treating them well. Would really recommend this place to anybody visiting this beautiful city.","50"

"UkMoonbeam","We'd been to Krebsegaarden before, but this time couldn't decide what to eat and were encouraged to try the tasting menu: we had five little courses and plenty of delicious home-baked bread, plus dessert, and glasses of wine to match every course. The value for money was astonishing, considering how much we were offered. Crayfish salad is particularly fresh and novel-tasting; then melt-in-mouth tenderloin with polenta, the house bacalao (salt cod in tomato sauce) and, best of all, skin-on trout with dill sauce and rosemary potatoes; creme caramel was delicious too. Our host is a joker and does a droll double act with his chef colleague; they both enjoy popping up and introducing the food and drink with infectious enthusiasm. There are very few tables and a calm and happy-making atmosphere. Reserve in advance, as they said they had turned tens of people away the night we visited.","50"

"Lille M","This restaurant is a real gem! It offers a small but varied menu, of 3 starters, 3 mains and 3 deserts. You can choose wether you'd like a small or normal size portion, which is great as you might want to save some room for that desert! The food is made with such love and skill, it's a joy to eat it. I had the crayfish salad, which was made just like it should be, juicy but not too ""wet"" and so fresh! For mains, I chose the osso bucco, which was truly delishious and oh so tender. And then the desert. Oh my....the chef's own creme caramel. I am a massive fan of anything caramel, but this is the best I've ever had. Hands down! I was actually a bit upset when I finished it because I knew it will be a while before I had any more.  The people I had dinner with, are wine lovers. They got the perfect wine from our fabolous waiter Mats, who is a real connoisseur. In fact, the whole restaurant only consists of 3 people (chef Carsten and a kitchen help), but they make it seem like there is a massive team behind them as everything is run so smoothly and with love and such attention to detail. No, you won't get a cold Tuborg, but you will get amazing drinks that are carefully selected to compliment the meal.   The prices aren't too bad either. You can, as mentioned above, select the size of your portions, so you decide how much you want to spend in that way. But if you do pick the smaller portion, I can guarantee you'll wish you had the normal one once you taste it. I will come back every time I'm in Copenhagen.","50"
"Itsmeagain2","A small menu (3 choices per course) of beautifully cooked, locally sourced where possible, delicious food.  The knowledge of the food and drink bu the staff here was outstanding.  I particularly appreciated the choice of smaller (about two thirds) or normal portions. They were happy to let two of our party share a normal cheeseboard... which was the best I've had since the 'Cloche a Fromages' in Strasbourg.   Matching wines by the glass are an option with any or all of the courses and were well chosen.  Try not to fill up on the plentiful, delicious home made bread... You need room for the rest!","50"

Everything had a very personal touch, from suggesting we shared a main course as a starter to offering us matching wines by the glass (again not an option on the menu). The 2 guys who run the restaurant are really interesting and good fun! Their concept is to match the food to the artist they are displaying work from, whereever the artist may be from in the world. One month it could be Italian and the next Brazilian!  It may not look like much from the street but I REALLY recommend this restaurant if you are in CPH. It was the highlight for our visit!","50"
"Hrooto1","This restaurant has a small menu, but each dish is expertly cooked. We had read the reviews on Trip advisor and were really looking forward to an interesting dining experience, we were not dissappointed. We opted for the taster menu, each dish is matched with wine, all the dishes were very tasty and the wine choices were great, we would have preferred a red with the cheese course, But Carsten asked to try his choice, we did and when one of us couldn't enjoy it he chose an apppropriate red. We found him informative and enthusiastic and not at all intrusive, we highly recommend this restaurant, run by a talented and enterprising young team!","40"
"travelbunny666","The owner who is the chef as well couldn’t do enough for us. I am vegetarian so he made me a special Danish dish which was really tasty. My colleague had reindeer and said it was excellent! Each dish we had he came and explained what was in it-such a nice touch. Would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant","50"
"Emma L","My Boyfriend and I were looking for a nice restaurant to go to during a weekend city break in Copenhagen. We read some good comments about Krebsegaarden on Trip Advisor so thought we would check it out.   We really enjoyed both the excellent food and wine as well as the whole experience of the evening. Pride is obviously taken across all aspects, from the nicely prepared and presented dishes to the attentive service and wine reccomendations. The food was fresh, cooked perfectly and was extremly tasty.   This is an ideal place to visit if you are looking for a enjoyable meal/evening out.  I have to completly disagree with a previous comment about this restaurant being anti-tourist, us being British tourists who turned up at 9.00pm without a reservation we were welcomed nicely & taken good care of.","50"
"bnbass","We had our fair share of good restaurants around Europe but Krebsegaarden lifted the bar again. The two guys running the place have an obvious passion for food and you will be wowed by the tasterange hidden in a seemingly simple dish. For instance, the crayfish salad seems really straightforward but they've carefully placed and cooked each herb and vegetable so that in one bite you gradually encounter different flavours and thus bounce from wow to Wow to WOW. Even a potato & leek soup becomes haute cuisine once these guys get started. Meanwhile they carefully select wines adding character to the food (instead of being a means to swallow). Eventually the evening is topped off with a large selection of Danish cheese to be eaten in specific order and building to a grand finale. The whole menu tells a story and is carefully selected and with much love prepared. What a treat this place was. And for a price for which you only have an entree at Noma, Orangeriet or Geranium. It's a small place so be wise to make a reservation in advance.","50"

"TottoV","My wife and me booked a table on email, and had a very enjoyable evening at this restaurant. We had butter fried scallops as starter, and redfish on ratatuille as the main course. As dessert we had duo of redwine-marinated/saffron-marinated pears with crumbles and vanilla parfait. The food was just so tasty and great! Erik and Carsten was giving us really pleasent service, and all in all it was one of the best dinners for a long time. One word about the house, it is also an art gallery, and they were showing the art of Mariella Bonnet, the owner of the gallery. We went there the next day, and bougth with us home one of her very nice paintings.","50"
"Marsu1972","I've visited Copenhagen many times and since I like good food, I often faced the quest of a decent (and affordable) restaurant. And now I found it (at least, I hope I did). Great welcome and great entertainment by Mats. Carsten did his work in the kitchen and it was excellent. Since there was no set menu, I thought the evening would be limited to a three course meal, but it became much more. Every dish was accompanied by a great glass of wine (and in case of the cheese platter - 9 different cheeses! - even two different wines). Great experience and next time I'm in town, I'll come to check if they can hold this standard. Forget Noma (although I still want to go there), in Krebsegaarden it is much easier to get a table.","50"
"lhi2i","Selected from TA as liked the sound of the quirkiness and quality - was not disappointed on either front. A 4.5 hour tasting menu session leaves me with one key word of advice - DO NOT select a full dessert - just share or you will rue the consequences. Food excellent, choice of accompanying wines very educational and satisfying. Very friendly 2 man team who are seriously into their food and deserve their success","50"
"wolfvalley","We were seven friends on visit to Copenhagen going out for a gourmetmeal. We chose Krebsegaarden partly by reputation an partly by recommandation, and we were not disappointed.  For our meal we chose the taster-menu consisting of five dishes accompanied by the wine menu of the restaurant. The menu changes quite often so what we got, you will probably not get today. 1. Bresaola - delicious thinly cut slices of beef. A beautiful starter accompanied by Leflaive's Bourgogne blanc, a superb match. 2. Risotto wth chicken. I am particularly fond of risotto, and this one was as good as you get it anywhere. Well made and perfectly cooked. The wine was Trimbach's Pinot Gris, and the only wine I did not find quite supporting to the tasty dish. 3. Sole - very delicate and prepared with distinction, paired with an American grenache noir wine (I've lost the name, sorry!) and surprisingly well matched. 4. Veal a la saltimboca with manchego and sagesauce. Beautiful tastes that I remember with a smile. The wine was Geol from Costers del Segre, and it stood up to the dish as expected. 5. Almond parfait. Home made and a perfect finish to our evening meal. The wine was Sauternes - Castelnau de Suduiraut, absolutely acceptable for a second wine, and a nice match for the icecream. Lastly - the sevice from Mats and Carsten was both pleasant and relaxed. We had a great time. Thank you!","50"

"Maya M","My husband and I found this restaurant on the ""Tripadvisor"" website while staying in Copenhagen at the end of August 2011. We walked in -- full of high expectations (thanks to the warm reviews) -- to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We soon found out that the ideal fine dining that we've hoped for would just have to wait for somewhere else, some other time... not today, and certainly not here! Just like a caricature exaggerates the fine details of a subject, to make it grotesque and laughable, so too did we feel this restaurant does to the entire experience of ""fine dining"" -- everything, and I mean *everything* was ""too much"". *) Too much praise: The food was portrayed by the owner in too many details (so much so that it got cold on the plate while we waited for the speech to end) and praised to such extent that it was too goo to be true. It was not even close to those high marks in reality. *) Too much salt: across the board one can say that except for the desert, all the dishes were too heavily salted. *) Too small portions: we realize that fine dining is not about big, over-size portions... it's about the finesse and the miniature. Still, luckily we came that night after having a big lunch. We weren't hungry. If we were, we would still need a danish hot-dog at the food stand at the corner of the street after this dinner. *) Too pricey: we found the price at the end ridiculously high, for a meal that wasn't worth half that price. *) and most importantly, too much babble on the part of the owner/ entertainer/ waiter: we truly could not get a full sentence across without being interrupted by his presence at our table or at the neighboring tables. He was loud, he took the stage, and we -- the captive audience -- sat there politely, feeling like guests in his living-room, and listened patiently to his entire one-man-stand. We had many things we wanted to talk about that evening... our lives, our kids, our trip to Denmark, our plans for the future... we ended up talking about nothing at all... we simply couldn't get to it, because there was a cheese ""lecture"" at the nearby table, or a wine ""lecture"" at the table across the (small) hall. And yes, to avoid the cheese lecture, we avoided the cheese plate altogether. At least we have something funny to talk about when we tell friends about our Copenhagen experiences. It's a conversation-starter... ...But not a place we'd ever want to return to.","30"

"pnl1962","Struggled to find a restaurant that could accept a business/client Friday night booking for eight ( after scouring our safe bet regular choices). Happened upon this place after a desperate seach which ended with Trip Advisor. I dont habitually review, but in this case I felt obligated to put something back into TA. My clients and I were bemused by the fact that a party of only eight had to pre-order food from what was quite a limited choice in each section. However, lack of alternative forced us to play the game. We arrived and found ;a pleasant ,quite small , 25 cover restaurant with modern artwork hung ""gallery style "" around the room. We dutifully took our seats before the ""owner-chef-sommelier-waiter-raconteur"" burst on the scene regaling us with his tales of woe in the kitchen due to the Copehnagen water E-Coli situation. His bubbling enthusiasm and general rhetoric immediately set the table chatting which only stopped when he admonished us for disturbing his cheese lecture at the next table! Only someone supremely confident in the evening's progress would have got away with it. All of the above is only to set the backgound for what turned out to be a wonderful evening. The food was excellent, the cooking methods explained and the owner was given free reign to wine match the food. Again, he did this to everyone's satisfaction. No point in going into too much food detail as the menu changes monthly and an attempt is made to link the menu to the interests of the resident artist who is displaying in the room ( and attached gallery ) . Dont be put off by the limited menu.. as Basil explained... do a little , do it well and have less waste.","40"
"montrealer77","In reviewing the tripadvisor scores, I realized that this restaurant scored as #1 in all Copenhagen. I was curious to see how it deserved such a mention. We were extremely lucky, not having reserved in advance, to get a table within 24 hours. The place is tiny, perhaps no more than ten tables, and each is booked only once each evening. We were warmly greeted by our host that seems to be the proprietor/cook of the establishment. Each of the courses is described in detail starting with the ingredients, the mode of preparation, the little tricks used to enhance the recipe. I even learned that political events in the world can have an impact on the availability of certain beans! Each of the plates was excellent. You should not miss the cheese plate: each of the ten little servings is also nicely described, and they are to be eaten in a certain order to optimise the experience. And, to complete this perfect picture, the price is exceptionaly reasonable in the Copenhagen environment, making this an excellent value. As I told our guest upon leaving, this was not a meal: it was an experience! Needless to say, reservations are mandatory for this place that truly deserves its #1 score. Price for a dinner for two, including wine and cheese plate: 1125 DKK.","50"
"IrinaGordonChou","We went there without reservation, we were lucky cause it was on a rainy night and the restaurant was quite quiet.

"GroningenCopenhagen","Visited this restaurant with some friends. The restaurant is in a central location in Copenhagen. They have a somewhat limited menu, but what they do they do very well! The service is very helpful from start to end. We had different dishes for starters as well as for main course and were all rated very good and even above end a couple of cases. The restaurant is cosy, but space is somewhat limited, which probably also made it feel a bit hot. Absolute recommendable restaurant, but not at NOMA level to be clear.","40"

"beehappybe","This restaurant is very small and cosy with short menu that changes regularly. The food is inspired by the art exhibition that is going on at the back.. The waiter (I am assuming it was the manager) was very happy to explain everything about each dish, knew exactly how it’s cooked and where the food comes from (he spoke fluent English). They have great selection of organic local beers. For desert I had a cheese selection with wine pairing. Delicious cheeses and fantastic wine-again I was given full brief on each cheese (where it comes from, how it’s made etc..) and also same about the wine.  The place gets busy and they were turning people away as they don’t want to drop the quality of the service so they only take in as many people as they can cater for. We had a booking for 7pm on a Friday night and received first class service. There was no turnaround for the table-we were leaving at 10pm. Would happily go back.","50"

"TnTraveler508","My husband and I had one night in Copenhagen before our flight out the following day. After a quick visit to Trip Advisor, I sent the restaurant an email requesting reservations, and I received an immediate reply confirming the time for our visit. Last night was the big night, and I must say, this restaurant lives up to.....and actually surpasses.....the glowing reviews it has received here. The menu is select as many have noted....three starters, three entree selections, and three deserts. After realizing that my husband and I simply couldn't make up our minds, they actually allowed us to put together our own ""tasting"" menu. We each chose a different starter and then divided two entrees. I can say without reservation that this was one of the most delightful meals we have enjoyed in years. The selections are unique and creative; however, it's the staff that makes the whole experience so special. Our server, Sara, and co-owner, Mat, enthusiastically described every selection and also made spot-on recommendations for the wine pairings. Mat was kind enough to spend a considerable amount of time talking with us about the ingredients that went into each dish and the techniques used to prepare them. This was much more than a meal....It was a true experience, and we left feeling like we had new friends in  Copenhagen. If we are ever fortunate enough to return to this beautiful city, Restaurant Krebsgaarden will be our choice for dinner every night!","50"

Only criticism is that it can feel a bit like you're sat in a shop window, otherwise perfect.","50"
"JHarris48","I agree with the positive reviews and have to wonder about the few negative ones. ""Ordinary homemade food,"" really? We shared the beetroot soup (75 DKK), crayfish salad (75 DKK) and bacalao (175 DKK). Nothing homemade about any of these, at least not in our home and my (third generation Danish) wife is an excellent cook. As noted, the chef/owner takes delight in explaining the preparation. The bacalao takes days to prepare. Another dish we did not try, red wine marinated wild boar, also takes days. The menu at this restaurant varies and now it is Lithuanian.Thus, the favored lamb dish was not on the menu. But the food we had, particularly the bacalao, a salted fish in a rich tomato sauce, was marvelous. There are small and larger portions on the menu, which allows you to adjust for portion preferences. BTW, the location is an easy walk from the train station/Tivoli/City Hall area. This establishment deserves its current high stature.","50"

The owner and staff ensure everything from the moment you book to the time you sadly leave is perfect.

"OpieesBakalaconzapas","After going by this restaurant many times, we decided to finally go in and try the dishes presented on the menu. We hadn't reserved and it took the waiter a few minutes to check if a table was free although the restaurant was empty !!! Once seated, bread and water arrived and we were asked 'what would you like 'boys' ?' !!! We chose leak and potato soup followed by Irish lamb and vegetable accompanied by a bottle of Barolo. After the order was confirmed we were referred to as 'gentlemen' !!! The soup arrived while one of us was at the bathroom and with soup all around the 'horizontal' edge of the bowl, the explanation had already begun before the one of us who was absent was coming back !!! The taste was good and the soup was hot. Then the lamb arrived !!! We had previously overheard that part of the dish was not available. When our's arrived, this was not explained however, the rest was explained but indicating that there were 'brussel sprouts' when there was o more than one cut in to 6 pieces was very funny !!! The taste was good, perhaps a bit rich and sweet but it was good and went well with the wine. There were not enough vegetables and hardly any potato mash ... After this, coffee. No espresso was available but we got a thermos of dirty water instead !!! Although the food was good, the loud waiter spoilt everything. He compared the wine decanter to a glass bedpan, shook the wine until there was froth on the surface and then served it pouring numerous drops on to the table cloth !!! He was loud, he cracked bad jokes and imposed his conversation that didn't necessarily interest anyone from what we could see. Enjoying a restaurant must be a complete experience and unfortunately we were happy to leave this place although the taste of the food was quite acceptable !!!","20"
"CJEngvall","This must be the most value for money restaurant in Cph. We tried it after the Tripadvisor recommendations and we totally agree. The lamb is a dish to die for. We had crayfish as a starter and it was very good, but not astonishing. But the lamb... OMG. I'll dream about that for months to come.  The thing with this place is the love and passion for food shown by the people who works here. They are in love with their food and you as guest profits from their love. The ones who serves you wont hesitate to go out in the kitchen to get the ingredients to show you in detail who it's prepared. You'll get a story for every dish. And trust their recommendations. It's worth it, and they have an idea for every suggestions of wine they get you.  Try it!","40"

"DrOmnomlington","Well worth the money. Out of the way, intimate with the lovely atmosphere. Relaxed yet quite and far from oppressive. The care and attention that goes into the food itself is really very evident from the outset. The surroundings are lit and decorated in a minimalist, clean fashion (Danish Design I suppose!).  The food was absolutely stunning (try their Bacalao - you will NOT regret it), the service was incredibly friendly with plenty of joviality occurring in the background.   The pricing was not cheap, but certainly fair - this place is well above par, and is most certainly not a tourist trap. The vast majority of customers were Danes.  During the evening, many people were turned away due to the place being fully booked so be sure to take care of this well in advance.","50"
"MisterCoconut","Food was of higher quality than expected, made with visible love and care.  The two Norwegian chaps running the place have a genuine interest in what they do, and the result proves it. Great food! The ambiance is not particularly de luxe, but pleasant and charming - although it could do with a thorough wash down.  Wines were high end, a little pricy, but an absolute delight - follow suggestions from the owners and youll have a great time. Service was very jovial and swooshy. Some, like a romantic couple, may find it a bit invasive, but I rather enjoyed it and felt very welcome. Not particularly inexpensive, but pretty good value for money.","40"

"kceesse","I had only one night here in Copenhagen and wanted a good restaurant. I went to Tripadvisor and noticed that this restaurant is placed at #1 with lots of great reviews, so I went there.  However, I was disappointed at the entire experience, and couldn't relate why other reviewers rated this restaurant so positively. Service however, was absolutely amazing.. Waiter was efficient, friendly, makes small talk/jokes and would shake your hand upon departure.   What was disappointing was the food - the soup I had was very salty (and portions are quite small even though a normal sized was ordered) and the bocalado (some kind of seafood stew) was also equally very salty and portions were so small and the fish didn't tasted fresh. I did not order desserts as I am already disappointed with the food quality.  Location of the restaurant is also a little hard to find as it is located on a side street that runs parallel to the main street.  I would not recommend this restaurant and I would think twice before I book restaurants based on Tripadvisor ratings","20"

"BarbM2015","I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the past 7 months. Mats and Karsten never disappoint. It's also interesting to see the latest artwork on the walls of the restaurant. They feature a different artist every month. There are usually 3 choices for each course and wonderful wines to accompany them. I usually cannot decide which one to order as they all sound delicious, so I'm happily accomodated with a sampler plate for each course. For the life of me, I'll never figure out the person who wrote such a bad review of this place, rating it only 1 star. I think he was writing about some other restaurant.","50"

"Skagerrak","Due to the warm summer day, we ate dinner in the courtyard, which was perfect. The avocado and pear salad was excellent, the bacalao rich and savory, and the petit fours delicious. The cheese plate was the best one we had in Denmark, and we tried others - it didn't hurt that the owners were charming, passionate and very knowledgeable about the food they served. The gallery was a lovely touch. We only wish we lived close enough to visit it more often.","50"
"LH0628","I tried Restaurant Krebsegaarden based on the reviews found here and was not dissappointed. It is a lovely little restaurant that is just far enough off the beaten tourist path to be a real find. The food was wonderful. The menu incorporates flavor combinations that are a bit unexpected, but not completely out there, and completely successful. The owners are wonderfully welcoming, as well, but not too much so. The atmosphere is welcoming, as well -- a classy casual feel, which the art contributes to nicely. Americans should be advised that this is a meal to be enjoyed over hours; the food is cooked to order and no one will be pushing you out the door, trying to get the seat filled again.","40"
"BellGray","Visiting friends found Krebsegaarden on TripAdvisor and suggested we give it a try. Great idea; I'm now a semi-regular.  The guys who run the place welcome everyone as though to their own home, which, given the tiny size of the place, it feels like. The menu benefits from being limited - everything is perfect. The wine and beer lists are good, and the expertise on hand is willingly shared. A great place to lose a few hours on a Saturday night with friends; don't miss the board of Danish cheeses with matched wines! (Only reason not to go is if you want something fast, mediocre and ill-thought out - Krebsegaarden is the opposite!)","50"
"Hilde_J","The first time I ate here was with a French guy whose obsession with good food & wine can be a little embarassing sometimes. But even he had to hand it to the two guys running this place: they know their stuff. I go there every time I'm in Copenhagen, and everyone I've brought has loved it too. The entire experience is a surprise , as you really don't expect such quality for that price.   Their Bacalao is the best I've had, and comes without potatoes which makes it feel kind of healthy. Also, if you order 'small portion', you can taste several different dishes. Fortunately, this dish seems to stay on the menu even as everything else changes when the exhibition changes.  Also, the Latvian apple pie was DIVINE, but that will probably not be on the new menu for the new artist.","50"
"Dyova","This is a fantastic find, on a fairly quiet stretch of the old part of the city. The room is homey yet sophisticated in an understated way, and the art on the walls changes regularly since in addition to being a restaurant, this is an extension of an art gallery in the back. The chef's changing menu is inspired by whatever happens to be on exhibit at the time. You can choose small portions or larger-sized ones for each course (we chose all small portions and 3 courses were perfect). Each dish was prepared flawlessly; the cod (""Husets egen bacalao"") in particular was cooked to perfection. Don't miss the Danish artisan cheese selection for dessert: it was an adventure in 6 stages, and surprisingly enough one of the highlights of our experience. The two owners are meticulous about the service, decor, and of course the cuisine. It's obviously a labor of love rather than a commercial enterprise: you'll find no pre-cooked, reheated dishes at Krebsegaarden.","40"
"pushen","I have only been there a few times, but every time it has been a nice cosy setting. If you don't like big chaotic restaurants this is the place to be!  The food is excellent! really good quality and everything is made from scratch by the chef. Perfect place for a romantic dinner as well","50"
"markusch","We are frequently visiting Copenhagen and try every time to find time to visit this small, rustique restaurant. The interesting thing is that the menu changes every month, which gives Carsten, the chef, challenges. Mats composes the selections of wines in an exellent way, showing up with unorthodox makers and tastes. Every time we have been there, about 10-15 times, we have experienced very good service. Hygiene level: Exellent. Don't miss this one!","50"
