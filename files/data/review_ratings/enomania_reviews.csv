"Praxibetel_Ix","You walk down Vesterbrogade towards Frederiksberg garden & the Zoo. You pass a couple of windows which are filled with lids/sides from wine boxes. You look up, a simple sign tells you that this is the wine bar / Ristorante Enomania. You then look through the window into a near naked room with a counter, couple of tables and chairs and think; is this what I was recommended? It does not look like a world class Italian restaurant, but do not get fooled by the looks of it. We went in and was warmly greated by the international staff and through a maze guided to our table in the back of restaurant in a cozy room, dominated by a giant wine rack. And let me just say, the food is good, very good. You have one menu to choose from, and I recommend to go for the full 4 course Italian style menu, which is reasonably priced. Then there is the wine. You probably cannot find a better selection of quality Italian wine anywhere in Copenhagen and not just the wine, the waiters knowledge of wine is outstanding. Be aware; you are more than lucky if you just walk in and get a table, you need to book well in advance and that is fully understandable","50"
"bennoc2016","Vi had a lovely dinner in a cozy atmosphere Good variations and great italian wine. Loved it. We had lovely tortellini, risotto, ox and dessert.","50"
"Abi M","Came in as family of 4, we sort of received a disappointed look maybe bec of kids 10 and 13?  Ordered risotto which was great but the rest of the family didn’t like their mains. greens were bitter.  Beware of bread and ham, cost 25pp-which is fine but would have been good to know that it wasn’t free, we didn’t ask for it and thought it was a nice touch - only to see 100krono charge on the bill. Sorbet was bitter, crust at bottom was so hard. Really wanted to love this restaurant because of the reviews so it’s disappointing. Maybe it was just menu wasn’t great when we went, but don’t recommend.","20"
"bjorkebo73","Italian family restaurant in an unformal setting. Rustic real italian food with nice flavours. Great winelist with good value. Kind and efficient staff. Very knowledgable especially on wine and olive oil. A great meal bringing back memories of real rustic meal in italy. I wish they were in my neighbourhood in Stockholm.  Value 5 Quality 4.98 Keep it up.","50"
"elvirasandberg","We had a wonderful time here. There was a wide selection of wines and very good italian cuisine! The pasta were delicious! We definitely recommend!","40"
"afbcph","Truly Italian food, super nice staff and great wine. A bit of a hidden gem that I will definitely come back to. Only set menu but that is only a positive when it is as good and balanced as it was tonight. Well done.","40"
"Halgrim","There is no a la carte menu. There is just one tasting menu, from which it is possible to select single dishes in different sizes. But it would seem foolish not to go for the full course!  Everything is incredibly tasty and well prepared. We started with ravioli, then had risotto with fish, then moved on to super tender and tasty meat, followed by dessert. Not a single thing we would improve.  They are big on wines (the restaurant is attached to a wine shop), but the wines are generally not cheap. That said, we asked for recommendations and had a few excellent wines at ok prices that were not on the menu. For people ready to spend on wine then this is a must. Atmosphere? Fantastic! We sat in what seemed like a newly renovated dining room with good ambience, but asked if we could move outside because it was too hot (one of the hottest days in August). We had the dessert and coffee in the courtyard, which was happy and lively even late at night.  Our only issue - we were there to celebrate a big birthday, but apart from a small flag on the table they did not comment. Would perhaps have been nice with some acknowledgement.  Recommended? Absolutely! This is undoubtedly one of the best picks for a date or a night out with friends or family. Can’t wait to taste the new menu next month.","50"
"HFranck63","Highly recommendable authentic Italian restaurant where the wine (not only Italian) is in focus and the food is classic. The service is top-class and you can easily leave the choice of wine to the host. TIP - if you are party of max. 8 persons there is a separate room in the basement. I will be back.","50"
"TFNLONDON","I have been here several times for lunch as well as for dinner. You got to be careful as it is a bit addictive! It can't think of any restaurant where the offer food, wine and atmosphere on this level. Price/quality (especially considering you are in Denmark) doesn't make sense in my opinion, its simply too cheap. there is no question I will be back very soon.","50"
"Per T","The food is best value Italian in Copenhagen. We took the fixed menu and wine menu. It does not get better. The staff is very friendly and the service is perfect.","50"
"GonkaP","Great food and an amazing wine selection. The restaurant is cozy, being divided in several small rooms. The staff is “mediterranean style” friendly, making the experience more authentic. The antipasti starters are set by default but they are quite good (bread and olive oil, ham, etc). The list is quite short and it changes regularly. The possible choices were 3: risotto, pasta and meat. We went for risotto (with cucumber, pumpkin seeds and halibut rolled in bacon) and pasta (lasagnetti with mushrooms and arrabiata sauce). The risotto was incredibly tasty! For desert there was strawberry sorbet with nectarine and chocolate brownie, and it was totally worth it. I’ll save Enomania in my memory!","50"
"Moses H","Seven of us were fortunate to dine in Enomania last night. The experience was truly memorable for all of us. The fixed 4 course meal consisted of pumpkin risotto topped with king prawn, a second course of homemade pasta (the name of which I forgot) filled with exquisite veal, followed by juicy beef, garlicy mash, topped with truffle shavings and a delightful zabaglione, ice cream and pear to finish.  Every dish was perfectly executed. We couldn't agree on which dish was the best. We shared a bottle of San Gimignano white and equally good italian red. Very attentive service. The final total bill was well worth the experience. No hesitation to recommend this restaurant. Deserve to move up the trip advisor ladder to top 5.","50"
"Lars M","Enomania is an Italian restaurant in Copenhagen. The restaurant is in rather humble localities, but its menus are real top class and an gourmet experience. You should choose the wine menu corresponding to the menu, and you will then have the best of the best. The service is perfect. The waiter will take care of you and your wishes. Next to the restaurant Enomania has a wine shop where you can buy the most exclusive wines.","50"
"ConnaisseurBram","This works very good if you need a evening where wine and food are balanced 😀 Clean place, and they share knowledge if you want!!! This works good for serious date's, business and of course if you are passionate about food and wine....","50"
"Adam S","Italy is famous for its cuisine and their wine, and this place proves that! Their menus with winepackage is well worth a recommendation if you dont want to choose for yourself.","40"
"vandenbg","This could have been a top restaurant in Italy! The only thing different is that the wine list is better here than in Italy! All the top italians as excpected but lots of other goodies from France and Germany as well. For example a Schönleber Riesling Halenberg GG vertical 2007-20016   We had the 4 dish set menue with Risotto, Ceppelletti, weal and Panna cotta, all excellent! But the wine.... THE WINE!!! Cavallotto Barolo Riserva Bricco Boschis Vigna San Giuseppe 2010, magnificent!  We went here on recommendation from a danish wine friend and from know on this is a must every time in Copenhagen!","50"
"PascalPL","Excellent value for money! Damiano the owner and restaurateur/cook makes you feel like you are at his home. We took the set menu with wines. The food was superb and there was plenty of very good wine to go with it! For price paid it is really excellent value for money. Only reservation I have is that the place could be more cozy/romatic. We will come back to try the new menu when available! Thanks Damiano!","50"
"Vesa J","This was my second time visiting Enomania. The first time blew my mind and I was really looking forward going there again. Now a couple of years later I took my wife there for a Friday night dinner. Luckily the first time was not a fluke. This small ""hidden gem"" is one of the best restaurants I have ever visited, anywhere. Their risotto is perfect. Their ravioli is amazing. Enjoying the four course menu together with a bottle of Barolo was an unforgettable experience. Please note it's closed on Saturdays. Book well in advance. I'll be back!","50"
"Kerny U","Great little restaurant italian-style with very high standards in both food and wine! Not open everyday, not to many seats - often occupied by locals. Don't anybody about this little pearl!","50"
"knuts333","A great success! We enjoyed a fantastic 4 course dinner, where the excellent food was lifted by the paired wines. The risotto and ravioli stands out as our clear favorites. Will be back.","50"
"YorkJean","This has been the best restaurant experience in Copenhagen.Felt you were very welcome guests.Fantastic wines and really good food to accompany them.We chose the four course menu with accompanying wines.Its possible to have two,three or four courses from the set menu.Tonight we began with charcuterie,followed by green and white asparagus lasagne topped with cod.Absolutely delicious- especially since the lasagna was so thin and silky..A Guinea fowl risotto topped with black truffle followed.Again very moreish.Thinly sliced beef and grilled vegetables followed.Accompaying wines were first class .The restaurant was full - mainly groups and family get togethers.At times there were waits between courses but we didn't mind.It gave us longer to chat and enjoy the evening.Nice not to have a time constraint on the table. The restaurant is easily reached on the 6A bus from the central station.","50"
"558HenrikS","Great authentic italian food - perhaps better than in Italy. Fantastic wines and a waiter with big knowledge about the wines. I would have given Enomania five stars if it hasn't been for the very slow servings. Absolutely worth visiting.","40"
"Igors L","We were a group of four and all of us tried the 4 course set menu:  Homemade focaccia with charcuterie as antipasti Risotto with peppers, fish and basil Cannelloni with veal, green beans and beetroot Thinly sliced steak with savoy cabbage, selery puree and potatoes Chocolate ice-cream with vanilla and pear  We all agreed that the food fantastic! While presented in a simple way, it was packed with flavor. Every dish was executed flawlessly.  We asked for a fresh and aromatic bottle of white wine and their choice was spot on!  The place is cosy, with great service and fun atmosphere.  Bib gourmand is here to stay!  We definitely will be back!","50"
"Ian S","A couple of friends at work had raved about this place and as I am a big burgundy wine fan I thought it was worth a try. I was not disappointed- the food was superb and the wine excellent. Great recommendations and I have discovered my favourite restaurant in Copenhagen!","50"
"rra_100","This is one of my all time favorites - I have eaten here several times throughout the years and it always delivers. Recommended in Michelin the last 6 years as a place where you get value for your money.  It is small roughly 25 seats and always booked so you need to book in advance. A 4 course menu that you can chose in and a wine menu is what you need to consider.   The owner - who is also the chef knows more than most about wine with a passion for Italian as well as Burgundy - so you have a great card to choose from also and you can have a great conversation about it too.   The food is Italian - and extremely well executed without being complicated. The plating is sophisticated trending towards simple.  This is a must when visiting Copenhagen - try it !","50"
"eirikandersen","This place is really a hidden gem i Copenhagen! I was told by a gastronomic friend to go here and try the food because of its brilliant silmpicity, I went here for lunch together with my wife. In the small cosy restaurant we were welcomed by Damiano. He was really a person who knows how to take care of his guests, We were served a three course lunch. The starting risotto is with no doubt the best risotto I have ever eaten. The main course was absolutely fantastic(think it was guinea fowl) For dessert there was served a homemade pistachio gelato with chocolate and crunch. All wines were perfectly selected by Damiano to pair the different dishes. Will definetly be back!!!","50"
"Renata H","If you want to go there you have to make a reservation in advance. The restaurant is small and fully occupied. There is no regular menu, you get what is in menu of the day, but trust me you wouldn't be disappointed, the food is sensational! Same story with wine. The owner takes care of everything, the food is fresh, simply and perfect at the same time. Go there if you are in Copenhagen.","50"
"Peter N","I have been there several times and the quality is excellent. The space is limited but cosy so book in advance.","50"
"toronto23frank","What a lovely restaurant away from the crowds, only locals ! We went for lunch and all 5 of our meals of starters, mains and desserts were absolutely delicious ! ! Service very good and given that it was a summer day a great setting on their terrasse. Recommend !","50"
"Niels L","Probably one of the best Italian restaurants in CPH. Fantastic food, and even more amazing wines. All served with class and a smile. Can only reccomend.","50"
"cph-hlb","This is the best wine bar in town. The wine selection is fantastic and the owner is great at coming with recommendations without ever trying to sell the expensive wine - but focused on selling the right wine for that customer.   The food is unbelievable - there is a set menu - but everything from the foccasia bread to the meat and dessert is tasty and more than value for menu. My personal favorite is the risotto - the best I have ever had.   They also do group dinners in the wine cellar!! This is a great experience.   The atmosphere is relaxed and service style is absolutely fantastic.   If you have not been - go tonight","50"
"Lotteslove","Delicious food and great service. Cosy place and nice atmosphere. Wine was excellent too and we had a very enjoyable evening. Definitely go again. Watch out closed Saturday.","50"
"523larsb","Always feel like your in focus. This restaurant/trattoria lead by Darmiano and he's great staff is ALWAYS a great experience not only because The food has The freshness and taste as were you in Italy, a winecard that goes beyound your Wildest dreams (often served by The glass) or The nice souroundings and top class service - once again we had a delisious experience - Altare, 3 meals course for a Price difficult to find anywere else ... Thanks again and Fantastico","50"
"281kristianl","Simply the best Italian in cph. Honest clean simple ingredients put together as you were in Italy. Add to the food Damiano and team as hosts and their great wine pairing knowledge.","50"
"Deb003","I am a foodie who has lived in Copenhagen for 34 years. Enomania is my absolute favorite restaurant. The style is elegant Italian (prix fix menu) and always good. The owner Damiano is a sincerely warm host who is extremely knowledgeable about wine, so the reasonably priced wine menu is as memorable ad the food. You won't find better quality for the price then at this restaurant. Make sure to reserve a table in advance as Enomania is a small restaurant and always fully booked.","50"
"Bregenholt99","Upfront disclaimer l: just love this place. The food is basic tasty Italian at its best, the wine....ummmmm, the wine is just fantastic, and served with opinionated knowledge. The atmosphere takes you straight to Italy. This is real value for your money.","50"
"246perhek","Simple food from great quality incredients was served to us throughout our dinner. Every single course from our tasting menu was extremely delicious. Our plates were just wiped clean when we finished eating. Great service, great wines! Must go back.","50"
"MissHale","This place is really nice. I need to get back soon. I love the atmosphere and I had a good dinner and the service was good too.","40"
"365af","Enomania is one of the best Italian restaurants in Copenhagen. Their food is always wonderful and the wine selection very good. It is small and not open on weekends. Booking a table is recommended.","50"
"FrishRingler","Not the first time I'm dinning in this great restaurant and it's definitely not the last. The food is amazing, creative, fresh, enticing, and the wine selection is superb. Very enjoyable! The chef is even willing to prepare vegan dishes on special request, and he does it with such fines and sophistication - simply an art! I love the place.","50"
"Matpapsen","We went there for both dinner the first night, ant lunch the day after. And even if the meny is small, and the dinner og lunch courses are based very much upon the same ingreediences, Damiano and his crew still manage to create simple and elegant dishes with new twists.   Delicious food, with elegant taste and nice presentation. No nonsence dining is actually what you get for a very resonable prices. And the wine selection is a chapter for itself. We asked sommelier Damiano to match wine to our food, og he certainly did. Lots of half glass for tasting too. Stunning! Exceptional service!  This is one my best dining experience the last decades. Highly recommended!  Make your reservation today!   Please note that the restaurant is open from Tuesday to Friday.","50"
"Mountainclamberer","Really great place. Fantastic selection of wines, reasonably priced for Copenhagen. Food is really good too, even though selection of options is small. Thoroughly recommended.","50"
"HenrikTheil","This is fantastic - nothing less !! Pls remember to book a table in advance, and also check for opening hours. I am sure you will find this super value for money","50"
"club88traveller","We enjoyed dinner with bigger group, all selected menu with wines. owner described all foods and told stories about wines and background of foods. Risotto was fantastic as a starter. Place is quite small and you definitely need to pay attention for booking in advance and also their opening hours, Note that place is closed on Saturdays too. Best place I ever been in Copenhagen","50"
"frankolsendk","This place is what any restaurant should aspire to be - a place where you the moment you walk out the door think, when can i be back? Damiano is the perfect host, you always feel he especially invited you The menu is the art of knowing your limitations; don't try to do too much, but what you do, do with perfection. And - whenever i think of risotto (which i often do - and make), i always think of Damianos. It doesn't get any better. Period. The wine list is of course totally out of this world - but the really fantastic thing is how Damiano pairs wine & food. Few does it with greater skills  Hey - i need to make a reservation...","50"
"Pletskat","I go there twice a year with friends. We get their set menu and most of my guests enjoy the winemenu. The menu varies according to season, but is always delicious. The service is nice and friendly. When will they get their first star?","50"
"792bentf","I had lunch there with two business partners. Very very good Italian food. Top class in fact. And a very nice and friendly service. Top class wine selection by the chef. I will Go there again and again and again.....","50"
"Bregenholt99","To me this is some of the closet you get to the classic Italian family restaurant in Copenhagen. The food is solid, well prepared and tasty and just reminds you of those Italian vacations. The patron chats to the crowd, and gets passionate when the wine is the subject. And hre is the key to a extra good experience at Enomania, let the patron choose you wine, relax you budget just a bit, and he is almost guaranteed to come up with fantastic wines to suit you your dinner and spoil your taste buds - and at a reasonable price too.","40"
"Travel98686","Visited Enomania with my wife and daughter on my wife's birthday.  Very good food and wine pairings from a fixed menu. Wine list was generally very good.  I enjoyed the Barbera for the second course so much, that we bought 3 bottles to take home :-)","50"
"Christian B","My wife and daughter visited Enomania on my wife's birthday. The food and wine pairing was excellent and the price was very reasonable. The Barbera wine for the second corse was so good that I bought 3 bottles to bring home :-)","50"
"kaaber","Its a restaurant hidden and away from the usual suspects and from the outside it does not look like much. You will be surprised as inside you will feel the warmth of the owners service and Italian accent :-). You clearly feel that each dish is specially made for you. I loved the food and would definitely go there again because its very good value for money and also not to forget a marvelous wine card.","40"
"Ksvane","Damiano and his staff are attentive and they are really there for you. The place is nice and cosy and Damiano takes pride in his craft. The dishes are often simply and offers a taste variety that blows you away.   The wine list is long and he has many gems in his cellar. Ask him about his stuff from Piemonte ;)  ","50"
"806262","Enomania is an interesting small restaurant with a limited number of tables. It is situated in the westernmost part of Copenhagen - close to Frederiksberg. The restaurant originally focused on good wines - hence the name (look it up..) - but has developed into a ""real"" restaurant with an Italian bias. The menu is very limited with only the choice of the day. However, not to worry because the food is always excellent. I have visited the restaurant several times both with business contacts and my wife - and I have never been disappointed. The food is fine and very well made Italian inspired and needless to say the wines are all excellent. The price level may be a bit on the high end but it is worth it. Enomania is one of my personal favourites in Copenhagen - I just keep coming back.","50"
"281kristianl","Pls dont go leave this gem to the regular visitors. Damiano and his wife and the great staff serve with enthusiasm the best food and wine pairings! Go for the menu and you wont be disapointed! Or take your pick in Damianos impressive cellar!","50"
"Benjamin4000","I went there Yesterday with a group of three. The food was good although you can dine better at the same price. The stile is Mediterranean. I went for paste dish with fish as a starter which was favorable and well seasoned. The main dish was slices of beef which was good but nothing special  However, the wine card is amazing. One of the waiters sole job is to serve wine. He is wealth of knowledge which is enthusiastically share. He ads a part to the experience that is invaluable. I would go for a menu with wine next time I am there  A last caveat though is one of the other waiters. She was snobbish and directly showed a lag of interested in my company. It is a shame that they have such employees. In particular when the former waiter I mentioned was friendly and inviting","40"
"JanochBarbro","Back to Enomania. Can only say this is a true gem! Damiano comes from the northern part of Piemonte and stays true to his origin, just mixing in some local ingredients to make food just as good as it is! Small Place, only around 30-35 seats, not open Saturday or Sunday (!) but usually fully booked. If you want to eat there, book, Fridays, book months ahead! A set menu available, at a very reasonable price. Wine cellar is fantastic, and at affordable prices. This is a favourite of many top chefs, no wonder!","50"
"B8582JXjohnp","Extensive and if you want expensive wine list for wine freinds. Nice well prepared Italien food and relaxed friendly service. Was here for business lunch and I think you need reservation hence the place is pretty small. Great experience a bit of the beaten track. John","40"
"AMKroyer","Authentic italian food and the perfect place for foodies and wine afficionados. The atmosphere is warm, welcoming and informal and the orner, who is usually present, is passionate about both the food and the wine. Check out his wine cellar, if you get the chance. Definitely value for money.","50"
"tangerine2015","It is a tiny restaurant - well more of a wine bar that serves set course meal is really like it. It is a neighborhood restaurant. Our concierge didn't even know about it.  Anyway, very friendly owner who did a marvelous job of food/wine pairing. I would definitely come back if I am in Copenhagen again.","40"
"hansmiddelburg","I work close to this restaurant yet had never heard about it before and what a missed opportunity that was. I was invited by a friend and was blown away. We chose for the menu and the wine pairing. The four course dinner was outstanding and the wine pairing, in most restaurants a disappointment, also really good. The wine list is nothing short of impressive, especially considering the size of the restaurant. The owner is the ultimate Italian as well as a great host. Finally, very affordable too! Will definitely go back!","50"
"batravn","Enomania has long had a reputation as being one of the absolute topclass Italian restaurants in Copenhagen. Hidden away on a humble adress close to the Copenhagen Zoo, you get excellent service, even better food (including the best risotto ever) and a wine cellar probably unmatched in any Italian restaurant, especially since the owner is not ""religious"" about serving only Italian wine. All of this for a price that is more than fair.","50"
"What_we_did_together","Great restaurant, authentic Italian with superb food and great wine - especially barolos ! If weather is great you can sit outside in a cosy courtyard...","50"
"byMT305","Everything that you've read about Enomania on-line is true -- the food is outstanding and the hospitality is wonderful !! The menu changes daily, and I would highly recommend taking-the-plunge for the full 4-course tasting menu. I have to admit that I'm usually a little skittish about set menus w/ no choices and that I ""flinched"" at the unusual-sounding ingredients (cod, pea, boar, etc) ... again, my advice: Don't ""skip"" anything. Go for it. We enjoyed the following: Homemade pasta course (agnolotti w/ cod & pea) - scrumptious! House specialty risotto (truffle) - outstanding! buttery!! Sliced filet - delicious beef w/ roasted vegetables with pesto seasoning **Pan-roasted turbo - for the non-meat eater ... the attentive chef/owner said ""No problem at all, & prepared a mouth-watering fish entree w/ roasted vegetables) Dessert - homemade strawberry gelato w/ whipped cream and cake - Delicious!! In summary, do everything you can to book a reservation for Enomania!!","50"
"Riplis","We visited Egomania during our trip to Copenhagen. We ordered a four course meal with complementary wine pairing.  The four courses was ravioli with cod white asparges and pies, risotto, beef with grilled vegetables and pesto, and strawberry ice-cream served with white chocolate cake.  All four courses were excellent. The dessert was outstanding and worth the visit itself.  The prices are decent for such great food. Enomania clearly deserves their Bib Gourmand status.","50"
"nikolaj K","For sure one of the best italian restaurants in Copenhagen. The food is very authentic italian and so is the restaurant itself.","40"
"Rasmus R","Absolutely delightful little italian place. Clean cut danish decor yet super cosy due to its intimate size. A limited menu with a handfull of quality dishes made with love. On top of a 20 page winelist, the heart for wine shows in this place. For someone (like me) who can barely taste the difference between red and white then the passionate gentleman still explained all about the wine menu with true dedication. Service was top nudge! This feeling you had when you were five yeats old and equipped with crayons and paper at a restaurant - came crawling up on me as they just succeed making me feel special and well looked after...","50"
"JanochBarbro","This is our third visit, now with a group of friends. This is not a five star luxury style of restaurant, or fancy ""fine dining"" but a small and crowded truly Italian place, with home made pasta, risotto, secondo and dessert. Menu changes so you don't know in advance what will be on offer. But it's like family home cooking, with a twist. And the quality of cooking and service is very, very good indeed. On top of the food experience, the wine list is absolutely fantastic. Great choices from Burgundy and Piemonte, and at great prices.","50"
"PerK514","A great small spot in Copenhagen. I have been here several times, in a business setting, with friends and with fellow wine-geeks, and every single time this place has been spot on  Go there, enjoy the exceptional food, the service (not only are they friendly but they know what the talk about) and last but not least the selection of wine","40"
"Elaine O","I visited this restaurant at the end of the lunchtime sitting with a friend I was visiting from England. We were given a great welcome and the staff went out of their way to provide a beautiful meal even though the kitchen was closing. The recommended wine was excellent and accompanied the meal fantastically, Highly recommended.","50"
"jr021966","One of the best Italian restaurants in Copenhagen. Risotto to die for, and an amazing wine list. Extremely nice atmosphere. Bib gourmand from Michelin several years in a row. Reserve a table well in advance - especially for Friday's. Not open on Saturday.","50"
"JanochBarbro","This is a small restaurant with rather simple decour - but don't let that fool you!! This is a top quality restaurant, visited by business people and famous chefs alike. Food is genuine, truly Italian of top quality. Slow food, rustic made with the heart and a genuine knowledge of Italy and Italian delights. Incredible wine list, formiddable!! This time we had lunch and tasted all Three available options. All were fantastic!!! The wine pairing was also excellent. Service reasonably fast and very friendly&helpful. If you can get a table - go there!! You normally need to reserve a very looooooong time in advance.","40"
"Jo65_DK","This place is ruined by Damiano Aliberti (an Italian) and his wife. Therefore you can immediately feel like you were in Italy. Great atmosphere and warm service. You feel like at home. Damiano's passion for quality wines is reflected in the bottles and wine menu. The food is authentic, full of flavour and tasty. Best Italian trattoria in town. Don't miss it.","50"
"Lawmoalem","Damiano's personal style and touch is unrivalled. The food is rich, tasteful and basic without being simple, and the wines cherry picked and very reasonably priced. It is simply the best Italian restaurant in town. I have been there half a dozen times, and I have never had a bad experience.","50"
"global_foodie_fan","I don't have a stake in this place but I wish I did but if I did I wouldn't ever go anywhere else in Copenhagen! It's now a must whenever I stop over and you shouldn't miss it. It's the very rare combination of sharply executed Italian food in a great atmosphere for not a lot of money. Incredibly, add to this a wine list out of this world at very reasonable mark ups, you really feel like a king (with your wallet intact) walking out of this place. The risotto with peas and sea scallop is Milanese style, al dente and can't be had better in Italy! even by Gualtiero Marchesi, the king of risotto (try him at L'Albereta in Erbusco). Don't miss but be warned, you can't just show up, book ahead to avoid disappointment.","50"
"RNdinner","This italian place is still going strong! Difficult to describe the menu as it changes weekly. But normally it consists of a selection of italian hams/ risotto / pasta / meat / dessert at a price of Dkk 375!!! The food is amazing, the service is extremely friendly, the prices are low and topped with an incredible wine list. The restaurant it self is a bit low-key but always packed so remember to book ahead to avoid disappointment. Would I come back? Yes, again and again!!","50"
"Shhh26","If you get the chance and from what I understand you may have to reserve a table, do try to have a meal at Enomania. The food is very very special and the wine is superb. I loved it, it was so easy, a small choice of dishes and wonderful wine to enhance each course. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly - so easy, but for a restaurant of this quality so unusual. It was a real treat and a great way to start my first trip to Copenhagen - go there if you can.","40"
"Bobbrs","It is a wine bar, but they also have a menu with 4 courses. Where one is a dessert. When you compare price to food quality, the quality is superb. Best value for money. If you like Italien food, visit this place. Service is, as service should be.","40"
"manyams","This is our regular for special occasions! We absolutely love this place. It is a wine bar, and have a set menu of 4 options (including one dessert). Each dish has a wine paired with it, and these combinations are absolutely amazing. We find the food here amazing, the wine is great as well and the staff is nice and friendly. The food is innovative, and delicious! We've been there twice, and both times we have had a great experience. The place is very small and intimate. It is definitely not a cheap place, however, it is a great restaurant in Copenhagen and the prices are definitely comparable. Super recommended for a special occasion!","50"
"Einar S","Situated right next to the Søndermarken park area, the restaurant Enomania offered a set menu (three or four courses) with an excellent wine pairing.   The kitchen offered a small selection of antipasti on the house while finishing your prosecco. First course was a ricotta ravioli with pan sired scallops and peas, which was excellent. After this wonderful start, we really had great expectations for the rest of the meal. Although the rest of the courses tasted really good, the kitchen seemed to have come to a complete standstill, and we had to wait for very long to have our next courses served.  The girl waiting our table was friendly and nice.  We’ll recommend this restaurant to all Italy lovers visiting Copenhagen.","40"
"WallingfordEl","While visiting family in Copenhagen, I was treated to lunch and fantastic wines! Having access to many, many Italian restaurants in Philadelphia, it was a wonderful surprise to experience whole different flavors, all authentically delicious! Great spot!","50"
"Lars S","We have eaten at Enomania several times. It's always a pleasure. Damiano, the owner, is the perfect host and his skills on wine is superb. It's one of those small brilliant restaurants that you shouldn't tell about and keep to yourself. Remember to book well in advance. We are not the only couple that knows about this unique place.","50"
"JessJensen","Food was excellent. Service was great. Wine perfected match for the food. Obviously not Michelin standard but a well deserved Bib Gourmand. We would diffinately go again. Enjoy","40"
"RNdinner","I have been lucky enough to visit this place many times ( as I live in the area )and I have never been disappointed. Damiano ( the owner ) is fantastic and he is all about quality food and wine. If you love risotto then this is the place to go. Only problem is that due to their great reviews and success ( plus they also have received a Bib Gourmand from Michelin ) its becoming increasingly difficult to get a table, so you will have to book a couple of weeks in advance, but its worth the trouble. ENJOY","50"

Four courses served in harmony with the seasons fresh vegetables. Call in advance if you do not eat meat.   Excellent service and great wine knowledge","50"
"Pkoch","This little restaurant on the outskirts of Copenhagen is a wonderful place. Be sure to book a table because they are open only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday but it is difinitely worth while a visit. We had they menu, with the wine menu and we had 4 dishes with some lovely wines to go with it. We startes out with some antipasta, salami and ham, with some lovely warm bread with olive oil on the plate to dip it in. A whitewine from Gaja to accompany it. Then we had the most lovely risotto, with pumpkin and balsmico - need I say more - the angels sang... Then the main course was some lovely Red deer cooked to perfection. Served with some lovely red wine, that I can't remember the name of now,but it was GOOD. Dessert was Baked Ricotta creme and with that a glass of Icewein. We really nejoyed this meal and we are going back and this time sooner than later !!","50"

"bartholdy","The set 4 couurse menu and preselected wine menu come at DKK 365 each ... This places Enomania somewhere in the middle layer. It's not cheap. But not expensive either.  The staff is knowledgable and friendly. The atmosphere is very friendly and the simple dishes speak for them selves. Lots of taste with no weird stuff to add confusion. Italian food the way mama *thinks* she cooks it :-)  The wines .. wow!","50"
"sandiUKLondon","Great place. went with friends that live in Frederiksberg and love the place. Everything we ate and drank was fantastic, my only issue is a common one in copenhagen and that is the limited options on the menu. Fixed course, so i ate more than I wanted and therefore it was pricier than what i wanted, but again, excellent food. would go again. Loved that it was cozy and seemed ""local"".","40"
"HelloBalou","We had the 4 course dinner with the wine menu. It was excellent. One of the wines I first thought was not as good as the others - but when tasted together with its food I had to surrender: it was an excellent choice. A little warning if you are picky: there is only this one menu, you can coose 3 or 4 courses plus as extra cheese. As a starter on the house we were treated with homebaked foccacia bread with the best olive oil I have tasted plus a choice of Italian charcuterie. They have just received a Bip Goumand and for Danish prices its absolute a bargain. There are only about 25 seats so make a reservation! The chef presented every course and the waiter the wines with a lot of knowledge. And yes you pay 45 DKK for the water (either plain or with gas), but there are refills for free.","50"
"ofy","A cosy small restaurant not too far from Copenhagen Central (Railway) - 10 mins walk - close to the ZOO garden. Open in evenings - and I would think important to make a reservation. The menu is very limited - changed weekly I guess - and your challenge is only to decide the number of courses (4 at maximum plus coffee) and if you want to combine with the wine menu. I will strongly recommend to combine with the wine menu no matter how few courses you choose. The combination of the careful prepared menu and the careful selected wines makes this restaurant worth the visit. At first I didn't think the servings were as large es expected, but in fact the dinner was also in that respect very satisfying. So to be recommended - and by the way an excellent service.","40"
"Sunshine811947","The restaurant Enomania is very praied in professional food reviews, mostly because of the great wine selection. The food is not very special and there are no choices. Beware of the ripoff this posh restaurant do: They ask if you would like some plain tap water. If you accept you will find out that they charge 45 DKK (8$) for a caraf of this alomst for free water.","10"
