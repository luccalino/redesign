The portion size was good and the waitress was very helpful in terms of steering us to the right combination of dishes. The food was very tasty so I'd recommend for lunch if you are visiting the design museum.","40"
"traktorweltweit","Took my Scottish mother in law and her partner here for Smørrebrød on their very first visit to Denmark. “What is Smørrebrød?” Ok, let’s go for it! This Little place offer quite authentic and traditional variations of the beloved open sandwiches. The variety is not too big and as a beginner you can choose a platter with a good variation. At this time of year it is called the Christmas Plate. We got 3 kinds of herring, a warm plaice and pork roast and some more. It was certainly huge and enough. The waitress was probably typical for a place like this as she helped with her opinion to what my mother in law would like.  We had a nice time and my Scottish part of the family can now check yet another gastronomical box.","40"

Would recommend","50"
"Jackie M","We walked past the open door of this little gem just before leaving Copenhagen on a Baltic cruise...as soon as we got off the ship we headed straight there for lunch... and it was fabulous! The lovely hostess/owner helped with our selections and every dish was delicious and the portions very generous.

"anaabrams","We’ve visited Cafe Komplet twice during our 5-days stay. Located near Nyhavn, it offers a great variety of traditional smørrwbrøds where you can’t see the bread under the topping. We tried the fish ones - were super happy! The owner is great, very friendly and hospitable, speaks many languages and can recommend the best options to try. Will come here again next time we are in Copenhagen.","50"

I strongly recommend this cosy place with family ambiance. The stuff is so nice and kind that you instantly feel home there! Also you’ll find excellent food and drinks there. We’ve never been disappointed!","50"
"mustaavalkosta","We needed to eat and this place popped up from TripAdvisor. I didn't have any special expectations for it. My girlfriend wanted to taste smørrebrød while we were visiting Copenhagen so this would allow us to take that away from the to-do list. The waitress was very talkative which felt a bit odd but that's because we are not accustomed to waitresses talking to us in Finland. She was very friendly though and somehow reminded me of my grandmother with her demeanor. Food was good and we left with our bellies full and a smile on our faces. Great little place!","50"

"KaroliinaP31","We found the place by accident and decided to drop by to taste the local Smørrebrød. The place was nice enough, though could be cleaner and I don't recommend a visit to the toilet. We ordered a plate of different smørrebrød toppings for 109 DKK each, and some, like the fish and tartar sauce were quite good. However the herring had an awful lot of vinegar and had apparently been warmed in a micro, and the mushroom salad had no taste whatsoever. Also the bread and cheese were the normal dark bread and emmental you can buy cheap from any given supermarket. We did not feel like we got our money's worth, but our bellies were full in the end nevertheless​.","30"

"Mary P","During our weekend break to Copenhagen we visited Cafe Komplet after reading the reviews on tripadvisor' we were not disappointed. We were greeted by the owner who invited us to try the set 2 course menu. 129 Dkk. Well what a treat. Started with lobster soup which was to die for, so creamy and tasty served with wholemeal bread. Our hostess even suggested a beer to go with it, hornbeer Grist, which was exceptional with a fruity peach flavour. Now I like my beer but would never had picked that off the menu, but it really complemented the soup. We followed this with pork and pesto, baby potatoes served on a bed of cinnamon apples with a mushroom sauce. Again our hostess suggest a beer to go with it, hornbeer wiessbeer, quite a light German style craft beer which just brought out the flavours of the food. If you are going to Copenhagen then this has to be a place to try, you will not be disappointed.","50"

"ClapsForGoalie","I found this place on pure luck. Was wandering the streets of Copenhagen and smelt bacon. That was enough to draw me in.  I'm pretty sure I arrived before they were open but I was greeted warmly and shown to a table with a powerpoint (so I could charge my phone). The host was lovely and friendly.  I ordered the brunch and it was delicious. A lot of quality food for a small price tag.  The cafe was cozy, warm and inviting.  I'm glad I stumbled upon this place and will recommend to others!","50"
"cythomas20011","I love the warm decoration, the desk cloth with red and white cross. Very traditional european house feeling.  The dishes with good plating and serve in a very resonable manner.  Especially recommended for a home made plate with pork and chilli apple sauce. That was the daily recommendation by the chief. The pork was nice cooked with a crispy outter and soft inside. The topping sauce was amazing with several layers in taste. What a bravo dish which we didn't expected!  The other foods are clean and fresh.  On the other hand, the owner and the chief is very nice and considerate.","50"

The food was excellent, and absolutely enough of it. Price is in the lower end for a capital city like Copenhagen.  Only minus and reason for 4 stars only is that it is not possible to pay with American Express!! That is a must in a big Capital city with so many tourists.  That said, we will be back next time we are in Copenhagen.  Highly recommended","40"
