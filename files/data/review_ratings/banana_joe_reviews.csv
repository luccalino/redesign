"RosieM1114","We had the vegetarian burger and chicken burger with fries. Really yummy burgers and extremely well priced. Joe was very friendly. Inside could do with a touch up. A great casual dinner.","50"
"xWhalosx","My girlfriend visited Copenhagen a few years ago and found out about Banana Joe through Tripadvisor reviews, and so when we visited Copenhagen at the end of April, we knew we had to go and visit. She had talked about how good the burgers were to the point where I thought she must be exaggerating, but after taking my first bite I was blown away by how great it was! The restaurant is quite unassuming, and if you didn't know about it beforehand you might imagine it is a standard fast food restaurant - you can smell the oil, see the kitchen and everything is tiled plainly, with a big LED sign saying Banana Joe. When we walked in, Joe recognised my girlfriend, despite it having been several years since she had visited, and greeted us both like old friends! We talked for a while and made our orders, then Joe went off and made everything for us - he runs the whole restaurant himself and does everything, which is impressive on its own, but when you also consider that it only opens at 5pm because he works shifts in a hospital beforehand, it's mind-boggling! We then got our food and started eating, and the freshness of the ingredients and perfect balance of flavours really hit the spot. I had the Banana Joe Special burger, the flavours were some of the best I've ever had in a burger, which was incredible considering the price, and I'll admit that at first I was a little skeptical considering the outward appearances of the restaurant. There was so much amazing food for the price we paid - throughout the stay in Copenhagen we would have meals which cost 3 or 4 times as much and weren't half as good!  Joe was so lovely and kind, and you could see (and taste!) that every burger was a labour of love. We enjoyed it so much that we just had to come back the day after with our friends, and because it was their birthday Joe treated us to drinks and dessert, as well as putting on music and just making us feel so welcome! I tried the salmon burger this time, and again it was so fresh and delicious - we ate VERY well those couple of days! So thank you so much to Joe for making an already fantastic trip absolutely unforgettable, and making us feel at home! I absolutely loved the food and experience, his slogan of ""Best Burgers, Nicest Guy"" is absolutely true! Not to be missed at any cost if you're in Copenhagen!","50"
"Анна К","Just came back from a trip to Copenhagen, heard a lot of good reviews about this place and decided to try ourselves. The taste is amazing! I loved the sauce in chicken burger! Everything is just made for you, very fresh and tasty. And the owner is super nice and friendly. You can see how much he cares about customers. Thans Joe, next time in Copenhagen for sure will come to you!","50"
"Jerpa A","I wandered in this restaurant with my girlfriend the other night. Banana Joe greeted us, served us, and gave us some great conversation.","50"
"Mada R","I first went to Copenhagen in 2015 with my mum. The city is absolutely wonderful, but what was even more wonderful was the little restaurant called Banana Joe. She read all the reviews on tripadvisor and decided we had to go try it, and boy did it live up to the comments. In fact it was even better than expected! The burgers were so delicious and the price was really cheap, that we went to eat there every day for dinner. The owner, Joe, is also such a lovely person and a very interesting to talk to! After that trip, I told all my friends they had to go to Copenhagen to try those burgers.  Four years later, I went to Copenhagen for my friend's birthday, from the 29th April - 1st May 2019. During the whole journey there, all I talked about was Banana Joe and how we had to all go try it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Joe had remembered me and that the prices had remained the same. It was lovely to talk to him again and learn more about him. The fact that he works a hospital day job, then serves delicious food during the evenings shows how dedicated he is. He really does care about people and making them happy!   My friends said the burgers definitely lived up to the hype and were impressed with the price, and how large the portion sizes were. The egg, burgers and flavour of the sauce all worked really well together. They had homemade beef patties, my boyfriend had the salmon (which was mouthwatering, according to him) and I had the veggie burger, which was also very lovely. So if you're a vegetarian, fear not, there are also delicious options for you!   As it was my friend's birthday, Joe put on latin beats for us, treated us all to soda and ice lollies, and chatted with us until closing time. He mentioned that whenever we come to Copenhagen we will always have a friend, which honestly touched our hearts.Thank you Joe for being so welcoming, serving us your fantastic food and making our time in Copenhagen even better!   Overall it has been an incredible experience and I highly recommend this restaurant! Please make sure to go if you have the chance, I cannot stress that enough!!","50"
"Aldafous","If you want to eat delicious food and meet really awesome guy, go for Joe's place. He has great burgers and also great life story! This is a type of place you will never forget! :)","50"
"Alicew08","We found this place due to these reviews on tripadvisor so we walked 20/30 mins to banana Joe’s. Upon arrival it appeared small but we went on it - despite it being empty. only down side was the smell of the oil - smelt like had t been changed in a while, Nevertheless we ordered and the food was great! Nowhere near as greasy as expected by the smell! The Owenr was friendly and talked us through the menu in English. When we left he had 8 people dotted around on various chairs inside and outside - would definitely recommend !","40"
"425marvin_","The burgers were great and the price is really cheap for being CPH. The owner was extremely nice! 10/10!","50"
"vegazbabz","They claim to have the best burgers in Copenhagen. This is by far an over-exaggeration. The burgers are not close to the quality you find around the area or in Copenhagen in general. I had the chicken burger and the special burger as well as french fries. It is a lot cheaper than other places, but the quality is also like the price. The bun was standard from the supermarket and the fries were over-salted.","30"
"lisabP9345XD","My husband, daughter and I ate here on Saturday as soon as it opened. Banana Joe was definitely worth the walk over the bridge from our hotel. Fresh made burgers with delicious toppings hit the spot. The owner is very welcoming, and we enjoyed talking to him. Don’t miss this place on your visit to Copenhagen!","50"

"Alexey S","1) The Owner: I probably won't add much to already brilliant reviews about this guy. But trust me, he is one of the main attractions in Copenhagen. He works in a local Hospital in the mornings and then makes burgers in the evenings. 2) The Burgers: I have tried all burger except a Vegitarian one (Beef, Chicken and Salmon) and can say that all of them are very tasty and the main secret is in their meat (fish) steaks, - they are very well cooked. 3) The Prices: they are probably even lower than in Mc'Donalds. On top of it Joe gave me an extra steak all the time and gave discounts on the final price.  All in all I can say that Joe's intention is not to rip you off because you need to eat in an unfamiliar city (what all the restaurants do), but to supply you with the best burger at a super affordable price and have a nice talk with you.","50"
"801_ricn","The burgers were delicious and, on top of all, the owner was very friendly and gave us some great advice about the city ! 10 out 10 would go again !","50"
"Yusuf_Miah","Me and my wife visited this restaurant when we came to Copenhagen for our first meal here. I had read the reviews (which were very positive) on this website and wanted to check it out and so made the 2km journey from our AirBnB to the restaurant. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious (We ordered veggie burgers) and the portions were very large. The price was also very cheap, much cheaper than most other restaurants in Copenhagen. The owner was very friendly and made sure our experience dining there was the best it could be. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Copenhagen.","50"
"seeingthesights844","Delicious, juicy burgers. This was the second time I've eaten at Banana Joe - the opportunity to eat one of these delicious burgers again was definitely a factor in my decision to visit Copenhagen a second time. It's easy to get here on the bus - a short walk from the bus stop. Joe makes amazing burgers - I'm already dreaming about them again!","50"
"sightstosee1011","This is the second time I've visited and it was just as delicious as last time. Delicious burgers at a very affordable price. Not to mention the excellent company of the owner. This trip has cemented itself as a must visit place to eat in Copenhagen.","50"

"Kandig","Just around the corner from our hotel in Norrebro - read the reviews and tracked it down. Very good value. Fantastic burgers and friendly service - just what you need after a day of sightseeing.","50"
"sightstosee1011","This is a real hidden gem of Copenhagen. A bit hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for because it isn't exactly what you would expect after the hype. But this restaurant is the very example of why you don't judge a book by its cover.  It's a small restaurant that serves mouth-watering, delicious burgers - all made by one man. They were so good that I just needed to buy one more for the road home. It is honestly mind boggling how delicious the burgers are for how cheap it is, I felt like I was eating something triple the price. And the sauce used was something to die for. The owner himself is a very kind man goes out of his way to make his customers comfortable and happy. Will definitely come back again when I visit Copenhagen again. Thanks Joe","50"
"Purplekitty1980","My Boyfriend read the reviews and it sounded great, it is easy to walk past as it wasn’t what we expected. The owner is such a nice guy. There is a limited menu but what is on it he does very well. We opted for two special burgers and we sat outside on the tables on the pavement. Absolutely delicious, the sauce is by far the best Ive ever tasted. If we visit Copenhagen again we will definitely go back","50"
"kath l","Went based on trip advisor reviews...sooooo glad we did! Okay so this place is not a looker and you would be forgiven for walking straight past. ..but don't! Chicken burger & salmon burger shared between friends...we went fairly late so ended up with a salmon burger EACH as well as a half chicken burger and chips. Superb! Crisp fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onion, seeded burger bun, fresh chips....chicken delish & salmon delisher! !! We sat at the pavement table outside, served on a crockery plate. ..very nice surprise...with cutlery & all at an incredible price. Owner is a smashing chap, nothing too much trouble. GO...you won't be disappointed...","50"
"alwaysFryday","You'd pass right by this spot if you didn't know to look for it--but once you've been, you won't forget it! It's a one-man show, but that doesn't keep ""Joe"" from making time for quality conversation along with delicious burgers and fries (also chicken, fish, and vegetarian options). Open 5-10 nightly (as of 9/6/18). We'll be back, and we'll send friends. Thank you, Chiheb! Best wishes for you and your family! ❤️","50"
"youssefa894","I live nearby and was searching for a burger place to eat in, i found this place and i was not so sure about it, but OMG!! Its great, you definitely should try it. The taste is so good! The price is beatable and the owner is an Arab who is veeeeery generous off course! I do really recommend. Don’t miss it!!","50"
"x_maddiie_x","My partner and I were in Copenhagen recently, and were in search of decent food that didn’t cost our entire life savings (like most other food options in the area). We stumbled upon Banana Joe’s which had great reviews and at price that suited us perfectly! The joint was a a few km’s from our accom, but only took ~10mins on pushbike. Upon arriving, I wasn’t sure the place was open as it did seem v empty and bare, but we were soon greeted by a very friendly Joe. The menu was small but to me, that means he did these things well, no room for error! We ordered a Joe’s special burger and a salmon burger and chips to share. Additionally, Joe spoke perfect English (refreshing to a couple of young Aussies who have never been to Denmark). Joe went to the effort of halving everything and plating up for us so we didn’t have to make a mess sharing off any plates. Halfway through, Joe brought us out a glass of fresh banana and strawberry smoothie, at no charge, simply because he had made some for himself and wanted to share. The burgers were divine, made from fresh ingredients and the chips were perfect with plenty of chunky sea salt! The total bill came to 125SEK for two people and we left with full tummies! Honestly, I could not fault Banana Joe’s burger joint. The service and the food were second to none. I would definitely return next time I find myself in Copenhagen and would recommend to anyone visiting the area! You will not be disappointed!","50"
"Storyteller524520","Top class veggie burger and great meat too (according to my partner). The customer service is lovely and the price is unbeatable. A must visit if you’re into burgers with no fuss and great taste.","50"
"Eric9026","I ordered luksus burger and it tasted like pieces of heaven. Awesome quality for the price. It's a must go in Copenhagen.","50"
"peterdU1886XE","Called in after the good reviews and I was very impressed. A fantastic burger and chips for 60DKK. Joe was talkative and we had a brief chat about travelling! Highly recommended for a family, couple or solo traveller like myself.","50"
"carolagripino","We ordered 2 burgers and fries (Luksus Burger and Vegetarburger). Awesome taste and the vegetarian was a monster. Delicious!","50"
"Xtomeh713","Feel like a delicious burger with amazing flavor and even better friendly service? Well Banana Joe's is the place to go. The menu is simple and cheap (unlike the food) The food is made fresh to order and with every savory bite bursting with flavor, your mind will beg for more. A definite place to visit. If you eat one meal...at the Banana Joe's.","50"
"Britt D","We had a blast at Banana Joes! 2 of us ordered the banana joe burger and 2 ordered the salmon burger. It was great! The burgers are made with fresh ingrediants and practically melt in your mouth. But even better than the food was Banana Joe’s company, easily the coolest guy we met all vacation with the coolest stories. His burgers are the cheapest in town but his customer service and product quality are the best in town. You can tell he makes every burger with care and really cares for his customers. I would recommend his place to anyone even remotely near. Thank you Banana Joe for a great experience we won’t forget!   -The Dunnells","50"
"Dot1968","Go to Joe,you won't be sorry.Where else do you get a friendly chat, pat on the back and a handshake after your burger?","50"
"Natswel","The owner is so nice, he also speaks several languages alongside Danish, English, French... The burgers are cheap and really good. A must !","50"
"nishikis2017","Don’t let the look fool you. This guy know how to make burgers, and makes an effort to give you the best service. He loves to chat with his customers, and his prices are the same for 8 years! Great sweet barbecue sauce on the special burger.","50"

"IzGB","One of the best burgers I've ever eaten and definitely the best burger sauce I've ever had. Brilliant, warm customer service. His upbeat and positive outlook on life fills the shop and makes the burger taste even better. Would definitely return and 100% recommend.","50"

"257ellenj","Banana Joe is a very small, low key place where you would probably not go in if you are looking for a fancy or a even an average restaurant. Trying not to judge it by the appearance (as we had heard great things about it) we gave it a shot and weren’t disappointed! The burgers are super tasty, probably the best I have had in Copenhagen! I could taste how fresh the products were and how thoughtfully everything was prepared. I had a chicken burger and my boyfriend the classic Banana Joes burger with an egg. My chicken was fried perfectly,it was juicy and soft. The sauce was very delicious and the fries were crispy. We had a small chat with the owner, who is the heart of the place. He is super friendly and nice. He said he only cares that his customers are happy and have a nice meal. And this is not it: we payed 160 dkk for 2 burgers, fries and 2 drinks. You wouldn’t even get just a burger this delicious for 160 in Copenhagen. With all this said - Banana Joe is the right place to go if you care about fresh products,amazing taste and great hospitality!","50"
"andr_1342133","Walked a long way to get there and really looked forward to eat a good burger. When we arrived we learned that the owner decided to close up 20 minutes early without notice. 1 Star from me for bad service, can't comment on the food as I wont go back","10"
"Satya P","Our number one burger in Copenhagen, every week, sometimes two times a week with my wife. Huge, tasty, and filling burger with a signature sauce. And the best part is the owner, a great person, a loving person, full of stories, you can talk about anything with him. If you're craving a burger and want to have a conversation, Banana Joe is the place.","50"
"Agenturo","Excellent burgers and a lovely chef. I had the special, it was finger licking good. A bit of a handful to eat, but it's fun to get messy with such delicious food","50"
"Tribhuvanesh O","We stopped by for dinner at this low key joint. Joe was very friendly and served us really nice, filling juicy burgers. We especially loved the sauce used. The veggie patty seemed to be prepared with a huge variety of ingredients.","50"

"dominicl721","Visited Banana Joe’s with my gf on the 3rd night of our trip, had always been on our ‘to do list’ but was too busy each time we passed it.   We walked in an ordered 1 burger and a large chips and a can of juice with the aim of sharing it due to shortage of funds! (id also brought with me a lager which Joe let me drink at the table) However what was brought to the table was not what we’d ordered, Joe had recognised that we were maybe a bit strapped for cash at the end of our hols and had prepared 2 full burger meals for us. This is the kind of gesture that makes banana joes what it is, after our meal we spoke with joe about how and why he runs his business the way he does and why he’d never change, friendly chat included anecdotes about customers he’d had in the past from scotland also which further added to the friendly atmosphere.  *****","50"
"706stefano","Joe is a very kind guy who is able to make delicious burgers. We've tried the special burger which has an egg on the beef. It tasted very good, the fries are good, too, served together with some ketchup and mayo. All together with a 0,5 l soda it costs less than 90 Kn. It's definitely worth trying it. Credit cards are supported as well.","50"
"Expedition209793","Went on what appeared to be a busy night. Buns were a little hard and fries a little over-fried. Would probably choose somewhere else in this neighborhood with a wide variety of restaurants.","30"
"AllyMelpo","What a great experience - the shop is small and unassuming and only open in the evening - so we were not sure about whether it would be open to try out. Definitely the friendliest and most welcoming owner/ cook - and a great quality meal. We had veggie and chicken burgers and both were tasty, fresh and plenty. There was lots to ensure we would come back again. This is not a place for people looking to sit down and dine, but is definitely for those who appreciate good, simple burgers with a welcome and a smile to go along with it. Thanks!!","50"
"Snorre R","Not fancy at all, just the simple, tasty quality that comes from a quality party, with out the pretentious aspirations that so many other Copenhagen burger places have.","50"
"LeeG905","Well priced fresh tasty burgers, really friendly and attentive owner. Set on a nice quiet street, seating outside. Highly recommended","50"
"antoniopedro64","We came thanks to the great reviews on Tripadvisor and Yelp and we have to say we're still puzzled as to how people rate this a 5 star burger or the best burger in Copenhagen. The patty was very standard and over peppered, the buns were burnt and the famous sauce was sweet tasting and runny (sort of a watered down curry ketchup with yoghurt sauce). The owner was indeed friendly, gave us a free strawberry popsicle and checked to make sure everything was ok. The fries were excellent, perfectly crisp and salted, we'd come back for those alone but not the burger.","20"
"martinjdixon","Delicious burgers! I have the cheesseburger, my girlfriend had the chicken. They were both amazing. Joe is a very welcoming guy and sat and had a chat with us and one of his regulars. A dmall place with an intimate atmoshphere which is quite rare in a city with more high end (stuffy) restaurants. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked, the toppings were fresh, and the special sauce is incredible! Fries also very good. Probably the best fast food restaurant I've ever visited. Small menu done extremely well.","50"
"Inimac","Seriously yummy burger and good size, we decided to share and Joe split the budget to make it easier for us, we had the special and it was delish, hoping to come back and try the others!","50"

"AmirP613","Banana Joe, a man of many traits with an amazing life story and humongous heart makes the best  burgers around full of toppings of the freshest and best quality produce - in a small & cozy place (don't expect much but the energy is great). One and only Joe Banana !! Will come back for more ....","50"

"Susan R","Me and my wife stopped in for a burger because we had heard they were great at Banana Joe""s. Menu was in Danish but Joe came out from behind the counter and explained it to us in English. There's a few chairs outside so we went out there and waited for our burgers. When they came they were quite large and super tasty. Joe has this secret sauce that he puts on them and it is really good. When we were about done Joe came out with a dessert we didn't order and talked to us for some time during which we told him we had been married for 47 years. When I went to pay Joe gave us a huge discount saying that no one stays married in Denmark for that long. Since the food was so good I tried to turn down the discount but he wouldn't let us. What a great guy!!","50"
"Mylinda M","I got the Banana Joe special and it was great; it's one of the best burgers I've ever had and I don't usually like burgers. Customer service (Banana Joe being the only person working) is the best.","50"
"Jakko16","Don't be fooled by the exterior of the restaurant! Get inside and meet Joe and try his burgers, chat with him and have a great time! Joe was one of the friendliest people we have ever met, and he served us one of the best burgers we ever tried. He only has his restaurant open at night, so make sure to have one night reserved for this experience!","50"

A must go for a fast food in Copenhagen for us. And the owner speak danish, french, german...","50"
"Judy F","I was skeptical when we arrived at the small restaurant. the first bite affirmed all the previous 5 star reviews. Burgers were tasty and well seasoned. The 'secret sauce' added a layer of flavor that was subtle yet amazing. All the vegetables were fresh (seriously some of the best iceberg lettuce for however weird that sounds)... So simple yet so delicious. Incredibly juicy but not greasy. Fries were also perfect. All from a 1 man operation. Plus, he is super nice... gave the kids an ice pop as we left.  I want to add that my kids devoured these...even the veggies! It was simply that well made they didn't stop to take it apart!!! Definitely the best burger we've had in 3 years traveling across Europe. Thanks Joe!!  ","50"
"HeapsAiden","If we are lucky there are a few experiences that really change you perspective on the world, those profound epiphanies that happen around one event. I am happy to say that one of these moments happened for me at this quaint burger shop on my holiday in Copenhagen.  Banana Joe's has all but 5 burgers on his menu, 4 of which a different variations on his beef burger and one a salmon burger. I couldn't decide which I preferred, the beef with the lot or the salmon, so I flipped a coin. I got the salmon.   A very talkative and instantly loveable gentlemen that went by the name Joe instantly started preparing my burger. He showed me the size of the salmon steak he was using, the proportion is the biggest I'd seen.   When the food came out he also added in a beef patty with cheese on top just so I could try it! The chips that I bought (to share with my girlfriend) where huge, a portion each. The food was delicious, huge and his sauce was amazing!   Cheapest, biggest, most delicious burger you'll get in Copenhagen no competition.  Then he proceeded to take a seat right next to my girlfriend and I and had a chat. I would usually not enjoy such a chat as I would be more interested eating my meal- not this time! While I was grazing upon his delicious creation we talked about his life, our lives, philosophy, the human condition, the warmth in everybody's hearts, work life, work ethic, family life, his amazing kids and how proud he was of them.   This man changed my life that night, it is what I imagine meeting a guru to be like.  If you are reading this Chiheb thank you","50"
"Teresa d","We got to this small venue thanks to Trip advisor and couldn´t be more grateful, the owner does it all and is really kind and knowledgeable, we went there from mexico and we´re a family of five and managed to create a great experience for us while we where there. The food is simple but delicious, the prices are quite low for Copenhague and the company is well appreciated. Important to say.... he speaks fluently english, french and dannish and probably other languages as well.","50"
"Jessica H","We went to Banana Joe's based off of reviews on trip advisor! My mom is visiting Copenhagen for the week and we wanted the best food! When we arrived, Joe talked to us for so long about where we came from and made us feel so comfortable! We ordered the two special burgers and he said that he would give us free banana milkshakes with them because mom traveled far. Joe knew every person who came into the restaurant and it was incredibly home-y and warm! When he was making us the banana milkshake, the machine broke. He felt so bad that he sent his son across the street to get a new blender! Then brought them to us (see picture attached)! We loved Joe and the burgers were incredible!!!","50"
"Dominika W","We found out about Banana Joe's through tripadvisor after looking for good, affordable food in Copenhagen on a budget. We arrived around 17:00 on a Monday and were his first customers. I write `his' because Banana Joe's is not comparable to any restaurant we had ever visited before. It is one man doing all the work, and the food he delivered was amazing. In this time of overpriced and pretentious burger restaurants, Banana Joe's burgers are a great example of what a hamburger should be like: simple, affordable and most of all delicious. During our dinner we talked a lot with Joe and got to know a lot about him and his restaurant. He showed genuine interest in us and did not just simply treat us as a customer. We will definitely come back and advice everyone who visits Copenhagen to try this place out for themselves.You will come for the food and leave with a new friend.","50"

"MNHoosier","Traveling with my son and daughter in law. We read all the reviews on Banana Joes and decided to give it a try. We all ordered the Banana Joe Special. We watched Joe make the burgers but we had no idea what all the stuff he was putting on them was. It made no matter as when he served them up they were delicious. Joe knew to give us lots of napkins because these burgers were so juicy you could not help but make a mess all over hands. It was a slow night and we were able to talk with Joe about life in Copenhagen and he wanted to know about life in the US. Great burger and great conversation.","50"
"Al A","The place you go to eat and enjoy great burgers. It's very small, but the welcome by Joe and all the personal service and the taste of burgers of course was amazing. Would deffinately recomend! Thank you Joe","50"
"Orfeas K","Meal was very good and felt homemade, the place though small, has a very charming, cozy feel, and Chiheb is a great host! More than worth it.","50"
"Igors L","We tried the special burger with the fries. Wow, this burger is juicy and delicious!   This however is not a surprise, because Joe prepares burgers from scratch on the spot. We saw how Joe was making the patties from fresh ground beef.  There is no other burger place in CPH that would serve so good burgers for this kind of price! Best value in CPH period!","50"
"Martina M","The right place for true burger lovers. I went to Banana Joe with my boyfriend, who lives in Copenhagen and knows the area and some nice places. What can I say, I ate super well, with the company of the legendary Banana Joe! The price is convenient, the place is cozy and, obviously, the food is awesome. Super recommended!","50"
"João C","When you go to Banana Joe,  You’re all set for a treat. Either Luxus, or special Every burger stops your beat.  Not all joints are special, Not all cooks are your friends But if you come to meet Joe He'll fulfill your demands.  It's not just the good sauce, Or the sound of his laugh; Above all it'll be memorable, And it'll make you come back.","50"
"Liam S","I have just finished eating my Joe's special burger and fries and i could not resist leaving a review.

"Will L","Banana Joe is one of the smallest burger joints you will ever attend. With a max capacity of 8 persons and 1 chef (Joe)who has been making burgers on his own for over 3 decades, you know you're in for a treat. The service is fantastic, the affordability is unbeatable and the quality of the burger and chips is amazing.  I am from Australia and have travelled Europe for over 12 months and this would have to be in my top 5 burgers!","50"
"klguid","Stopped in for a meal tonight and it was delicious! The burger and fries are awesome and the owner is extremely nice to visit with. Definitely recommend stopping by if you are in Copenhagen. Will be going back again for sure.","50"
"Alex K","This place is absolutely delicious. Great messy burgers smothered in delicious sauce and accompanied by crisp fries. Banana Joe is a real chiller too. Incredibly friendly and charming; he gave us free push-pops! Also, this is one of the best deals for amount of food and taste in the city. Students get burger, soda and fries for a smooth 60kroners. You won't regret it, you schmuck!","50"

It's not just about the burgers - it's all about making the customer happy and giving him the best experience and knowledge that you can get. Joe really cares about his customers - he welcomes everyone and is open to have a really nice chat. He is making his burgers with passion and love (the burger sauce is very incredible and tasty). It was an experience that you couldn't get at any other restaurant. I wish some day that I could travel back to Copenhagen just to meet him again to have a tasty burger and a really nice chat.","50"

An honest restaurant owner that takes the time to get to know his clients and makes you want to come back for more. If you have time, don't take the burger to go but try to grab one of the small tables inside!","50"

And the best thing about it is how cheap it was. i've been to Copenhagen a few times before and Banana Joe's prices given the excellent quality of the food are really unique. But the best thing about the place for me is Joe himself who is an absolute delight - make sure to stop by and say hi to Joe.","50"
"Franz B","Don't be put off by the small shop, this is not your chique American chain restaurant. You go for the burgers, and that's what you get. They are prepared with fresh and well-chosen ingredients (and care, of course), and you can taste it.   There's other good burger restaurants around, but the prices at Joe's are unbeaten - oh, and it's hard to find a more pleasant person to serve your food. Thumbs up, always a pleasure to go there!","50"
"Aemli","The burger did not live up to the extremely positive reviews here. First we thought the high reviews were a joke everyone else was in on. We didn't talk much with Joe (maybe that was our problem), the place only had a couple of places to sit, and the burger was, at best, average, in my opinion.  ","30"

Great burgers, amazing sauce!!!! Had the special banana joe burger and it was just great!! The egg and the cheese where rhe best topping for the burger. Not those fancy 150 dkr with fancy toppings to hide the taste of the burger..here you will find a chef who knows his job and making amazing(and simple) burgers!!

Joe makes all the burgers himself and in addition to making great food he is also a wonderful and friendly host. Truly recommend this place to anybody visiting Copenhagen.","50"

He even keeps clippings around about how well he's doing, and the fact that he's surprised by the (well deserved) praise is so warming. The food here was fantastic, maybe the best burger I've ever had (my boyfriend, a much bigger burger connoisseur than myself, can confirm). There are only a few tables in here and we had to wait a little, but there were definitely regulars there when we were.","50"
"DjJassu","The place is basic burger joint with factory made buns, ready made sauces and self made patties. Yes, the price is cheap but the burger is max 2 stars.  The owner is really nice, but really that and the cheap price can't make this place to be 5 stars place.   When making reviews only the price and service can't just make this place to be next Michelin star restaurants, or even next to premium burger places.","30"

Don't expect a fancy place, but do expect everything else you read about: tasty burgers, extremely affordable prices (16.5 euro paid for salmon burger, special burger and fries), high quality and everything freshly cooked on the spot and a very nice person to talk to. A lot of tourists are visiting Joe and for a very good reason...and the guy is right: people do come there for good quality and cheap prices. So...go and see for yourself!","50"

What made our experience extra special was the service, Joe was friendly, attentive and even surprised us when he bought out a beef patty and some chicken for my partners mother who didn't feel like a burger.  I would highly recommend visiting Banana Joe, it has been the highlight of our stay in Copenhagen, friendly hospitality and great food can go a long way.   We only wish we could have chatted to Joe more - he seemed like a lovely man!!","50"
"ashswal","Myself and my boyfriend visited Copenhagen in the first weekend of December and were lucky enough to be staying a 30sec walk away from Banana Joe! We discovered Banana Joe on the first night on a walk back to our apartment and to be honest we walked straight past and then checked trip advisor and then went in. I really wish I hadn't relied on trip advisor to give me the ""ok"" to go in. It made me realise I was judging a place on its looks rather then whats on the inside which I didn't think I did until that moment!   A little about our experience and the type of person Joe the owner/chef is: He works his day job as a cleaner in the operating room of a hospital and then opens up his store (Banana Joe) from 5pm-10pm and is there on his own cooking and chatting to people 7 days a week. He is the friendliest, most hospitable man you will ever meet. He speaks 6 different languages and is one an amazing story teller. He loves to learn about where you've travelled and where you plan on going.   We were so lucky to have met Joe on our trip and will never forget the amazing food and chats we had! We went in the first night to grab a quick burger which actually ended up being a 3 hour visit and us being invited back the next night as Joe wanted to cook us a special meal.   He makes amazing burgers and with so much passion and love. He doesn't have this shop to purely make money, you can really see this because of the type of character he is.  Now for the burgers: AMAZING! So much flavour and the sauce Joe makes is delicious.   Cant wait to get back to Copenhagen for a burger and a chat!","50"
"_amyyjane","Banana Joe's is little walk out from central Copenhagen (15/20 minutes at most) but definitely worth it...  I won't lie, I'm not sure what I was expecting when looking for this place down a couple of side roads, but this wasn't it - very much ""don't judge a book by its cover"" situation! Joe's is primarily a takeaway, which I didn't know, so there are always people popping in and out collecting orders but it did also have seating for maybe 8 people max. (very grateful for this after the walk in the rain!)  If you're looking for Copenhagen on a budget, or even just a damn good burger, this is your place! Like many other reviewers (because I took their recommendation) I had the Special, which was absolutely delicious, along with chips and a can of Coke... Now I'm sure you'll have seen a few posts/websites saying Copenhagen is fairly pricey, but my meal was less than 100DK (roughly 10DK = £1, so less than £10) which I certainly can't complain about - a Nando's costs more!!  Joe, the owner, makes everything from scratch there and then - which you can watch from the counter if you want. He's very friendly, talkative to everyone and is well known with the locals - no surprise, if I lived close I'd be eating here all the time!  If you like egg, go for the Special but if not, the standard burger is exactly the same, eggless - thoroughly recommended, but be sure to get a few napkins :-)","50"
"fififi13579","We went to Banana Joe after reading many many recommendations for this place. And we certainly weren't disappointed! We had a Banana Joe Special Burger, a Cheeseburger and fries. It was great! A bit difficult to eat it in a mannered way (so much sauce and beef and extras), but by far the best price-value-ration in Copenhagen. And Joe is a great guy with a big heart, who's happy when his customers are happy :) Go there!","50"
"D G","After trying two different burgers I got to say, the best burger place I've ever been in my life! The staff is amazing and extremely welcoming and the time it takes for the food to be prepared is almost none.  If you're in cph looking for a delicious and cheap place to eat and still be treated like a friend I advise Banana Joe!","50"
"Toh B","Banana Joe serves really good burgers with the difference being in the special sauce that he uses, but the visit is made complete after a quick chat with the owner.

"ezhinsky","We LOVE Joe's burgers and everything that comes with it! I Our first stop when we come from the States. Burgers and everything else are always fresh, grilled outside on demand, and Joe uses only fresh ingredients. My kids and husband always go for burgers and fries, I personally love the salmon, Sitting in the summer time, eating smoky, juicy, giant burgers, sipping beer and watching the crowds, it is an ultimate summer delight in Copenhagen, and cheap too, you will have money leftover for an ice cream. We 've become regulars, and kids become fast friends with Joe who always treat them with great kindness. This is my first review and Banana Joe is the reason I decided to write it. He is Number One!","50"

From the moment you walk in you can feel the warmth from the owner and the work he puts into his restaurant. The burger he made was to die for and we have gone back every Friday since our first visit. Joe has gotten to know us pretty well from our many visits and has only made me want to come back even more. I will definitely be missing this restaurant when I return home and I urge anyone visiting Copenhagen to head to Banana Joe for one of the best burgers I've ever had at a great price!","50"
"Santiago A","We googled ""best places to eat in Copenhagen"" and Banana Joe's appeared among the first options. As Joe says, at his place you are not a customer, you are a guest. You really feel like that. His burgers and his sauce are simply so great. Fresh ingredients and cooked like at home. The best thing is that Joe is keen on you enjoying the food and feeling comfortable at his place. You can so easily engage in a conversation with him with the greatest closeness. It's a highly advisable place, among the best ones in Copenhagen.  Encontramos el sitio buscando por internet. Como él dice, en su local no eres su cliente, eres su huésped. Y así te sientes. Sus hamburguesas y su salsa son magníficas. Ingredientes frescos y cocinado como en casa. Lo mejor es que Joe se preocupa porque te guste y te sientas a gusto. No tiene problema en hablar contigo con la mayor cercanía. Sitio muy recomendable, de lo mejor de Copenhague.","50"

"tylerjwain","We had heard the stories and read the reviews before visiting Copenhagen, which made a visit to Banana Joe a must. We hadn't checked the hours (5pm-10pm) beforehand and missed the window. We returned the next day and were treated to 2 custom burgers, huge heaps of fries and drinks. I love burgers and this was truly one of the best I've ever had. Gratuitous amounts of bacon and cheese, sitting atop 2 huge patties. The other had an enormous slab of salmon, tasty enough to be eaten alone instead of between 2 buns.   'Joe' sat with my wife and I and made us feel like old friends. He shared stories about his past, where he's been, and where he's traveled. He asked us questions about our trip and gave great advice about where else to eat and what places to visit.  We couldn't have asked for a better meal. The food was great, but Joe made our visit that much better. If you're on the fence or looking for places to try, go here and ask him to make you something special. It probably won't be on the menu but it will always be incredible.","50"

"Jo L","I'd done my research on Copenhagen before we left the UK, and had already decided that Banana Joe's was on the list. All I can say is, if you like burgers, please go and give Banana Joe's a visit. It might take you a while to find it, and don't be put off by the small 'fast-food' shop front. Step inside and enter the truly hospitable world of Banana Joe and his burgers - not just any old burgers but exceptional burgers with his secret sauce that makes all the difference! We were all made to feel really welcome - thanks from the kids for the chocolate :-) - and all this at a fraction of the cost of other cafes, restaurants and take-away venues in Copenhagen. Thanks Banana Joe!","50"
"aeholland","We were wandering round trying to find where to eat and stumbled on Banana Joes.   From a quick check on trip advisor we were like great 5* but could not see why at the start as its a tiny take out looking burger place. Anyway, Joe greeted us in English and walked us through his menu. We went for the chips and cheeseburgers which cost 90kr in total - a bargain!  As we left from having some lengthy chats he recounted tales of businessmen coming to find his restaurant and not believing what they saw as its so little and not ""restaurant"" per se. We attempted to give him a tip but he outright refused saying he does it for the kind comments and his own good manner which was great and refreshing.   Worth a visit if you're looking for somewhere not showy before heading to the bars in the area.","50"
"Dave_utrecht","No fancy menus with all kinds of luxury burgers here... Nope!  Just a burger with some greens. But God, the taste of that meat!  The owner has a normal day job and runs this place as a hobby. And you can taste that.   3 things to take in to account:   it is a fast food place with little space. Don't go for romance or business :)  He accepts only Danish bank cards and cash. So no credit or maestro   If you want a beer with your burger buy it at 7/11 on the corner as joe doesn't sell beer. He won't mind you drink it there","50"
"nadasequoia","It's a small burger joint. Joe makes his burgers up fresh. They are a good size and half the price of a similar 'gourmet' burger elsewhere. The veggie burger is also good. Eat in as you can't fit one in your mouth without serious spillage.","50"
"AnnaThorn","Banana Joe's is an amazing place to eat and definitely worth going. From the outside it looks like a fast food place but it's worth venturing in. The food is delicious, I had a veggie burger which was the best I've ever eaten. The prices are so reasonable too. Also Joe is a lovely man and came and chatted to us about Copenhagen and his life. Well worth going!","50"
"laurenn176","I visited Banana Joe with my boyfriend after discovering the shop on trip advisor and reading the great reviews. I have to say what we got for our money was amazing, I got a cheeseburger which was prepared from fresh mincemeat and the burger itself was huge. My boyfriend had the vegetarian burger and he said it was great and was better than most vegetarian options he'd tried. For both of our meals (two burgers and a large portion of chips between us) it only cost 100DKK which, in a lot of places nearby, is roughly the cost of a meal for just one person if you're lucky. ""Joe"" was a lovely man and I definitely recommend you visit him if you're in Copenhagen!","50"
"masoodm917","My wife and I visited this after reading all the good reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed.   We ordered the Banana joe burger which was a fresh ground beef patty with cheese and fried egg. The owner showed us the fresh meat before cooking which was surprising.   What came was a large gooey cheesy burger with a large portion of chips and the owner even gave us a free chicken skewer each too which was very kind of him. This chicken skewer in itself was delicious and tender.   The place looks like any other cheap greasy burger joint but the taste was nothing less than gourmet.   Highly recommend for a delicious, satisfying and filling meal...and actually cheap for Copenhagen.   ","50"

"David B","Banana Joe’s is a surprise wonder in Copenhagen. Excellent quality food, simple – delicious food at a reasonable price, and Banana Joe himself, the light and soul of the place. Take that chance, step inside, and give him the opportunity and the food, sauces, and hospitality will knock your socks off! Now I’m a burger fan, and in my burger I’m not just looking for the taste, or the size – I need the feel, the joy of eating a burger. Banana Joe’s burger meets all those criteria and blows them out of the water. It’s reasonably priced, filling with big portions, he uses high quality meat, cooked right so it has a great taste. It’s a bit messy, which is just what I want, and it rounds out with a full flavor which makes it better than anything else I’ve had in Copenhagen.   Even though it’s hard not to get one of Joe's special burgers every visit, I encourage you to work your way through all his burgers. The chicken burger is always properly cooked and full of taste while the fish burger uses real slices of Salmon, that is cooked to perfection.   The shop itself is clean, organized and the kitchen is in great shape. Banana Joe is a chef with a real passion and drive for good food and a firm believer that the people make the atmosphere and the place. He’s always on the grill, and it’s obvious he takes great pride and care in his food. He’s the type of sincere man, who treats everyone with respect and hospitality and welcomes you into his shop as if welcoming you into his home. It’s obvious the passion he has for his food and his customers. The quality of the food hasn't varied – every time I’ve eaten there it’s been fantastic.   You can drop by for a Burger, or for great company and good conversation. Humor, community and mouthwatering food all mixed into one. Not in the mood for a burger? Don’t despair, Banana Joe’s Taxi Steak, Chicken, and mixed grill plates are equally delicious. With a perfect blend of flavor that compliments each individual taste, and come together in a symphony of goodness. He has made a couple of special dishes for me over the last few weeks, and I have to say, he made a ravioli that was the best I’ve ever had. Without a doubt the most tender, delicious in mouth texture and taste I’ve ever experienced for Ravioli. He combined it with a perfectly cooked white fish, and then a second round he mixed it with a savory, tender, delicious pepper steak.   Be warned, the shop is designed mostly for take away, and there is only counter/seating space for about six people, with two or four more seated outside. That said, it is absolutely worth it to wait for one of those seats and get a chance to talk to the man himself. The owner is a one man show, and he’s passionate and friendly with a big smile, a great sense of humor and a welcoming hospitality that is hard to find in today's rushed modern world. Remember that everything there is cooked on demand, fresh – so be prepared for it to take a few more minutes, but the atmosphere, conversation and the food is worth every moment of the wait.  Definitely 5 stars for an economical and delicious restaurant","50"
"joscheng11","It's a hole in the wall and it's easy to walk pass without notice it. If so, you could miss the best burger place in Copenhagen. I visited on a weekday at around 5 and there wasn't a lot of people so I just sat down at one of the maybe eight chairs in the restaurant. I received a warm welcome by cheerful ""Joe"" and he even offered me a free coke. I ordered the special burger and it was the best burger I'ver even had, flavorful, juicy, fresh, and the price is unbeatable! The homemade BBQ sauce was excellent and the meat was cooked to perfection. The owner is super friendly and funny, a lot of people would just pass by and say hi to him. I am definitely going back to try other burgers.","50"
"473JoB","Our meal was so good we came back two more times during our stay. The food is made-to-order, plentiful (we were stuffed each meal), a unique blend of flavors, and well affordable. Especially in Copenhagen. Chiheb (aka Joe) creates an ambiance of warmth and welcome. His burger, his fish, and his mixed grill are fantastic! I am a particular fan of his sauces. It is a tiny, hole-in-the- wall place with one table and a few bench seats. A wonderful find.","50"
"tmFOTOGRAFiA","Been a regular customer for like 3 years and still coming back. Regarding the menu card I can recommend the Banana Joe's special - a burger with a fried egg on top. This burger is by far my fav but the regular standard burger is also pretty good if you are in a hurry. I also appreciate the student friendly prices though the burgers taste just as good if not better as the burgers sold in the many fancy restaurents in the area. If you pass by Banana Joe to check out the place please do not get scared of the rather small shop. In my opinion the service you get is always more personal and friendly compared to most of the larger and nearby restaurents. If you are in the area during the spring or the summer you will probably find Banana Joe frying his burgers open air! Like this you can have a burger right in the middle of the most buzzing area of inner Nørrebro for a bargain! Highly recommend.","50"
"C G","We had two delicious burgers, including a salmon one (WoW... ;) ). The menu came with chips and drink, at a very decent price. It was a quiet week night, so we could enjoy a nice chat with Mr Joe.. what a pleasure =) As said in previous reviews, it's a one man operation, which proves the love that he puts in that place and in the food he cooks. Are you going to Copenhagen, and want to eat a proper burger in a relaxed and friendly environment? You won't go wrong with this place. By the time we were there (August'14), the operation was running from 5 till 10pm, but I guess if you wanna be 100% sure by the time you're planning to go there, just give him a call first.","50"
"547louiseh","It's great food for a fantastic price. My youngest wasn't keen on a burger so Joe made her an omelet! The cheese burger satisfied my 2 other children and the adults had the special. In an expensive town with a family of 5 this really hit the spot.","40"
"TGFG","If you want a real hamburger in Copenhagen, this is the place. Great choice of burger styles or tell Banana Joe how you want it. Very friendly owner in this small restaurant with sidewalk tables. Downsides are no bathroom (has an agreement for customers to use another restaurants facility down the street) and it is CASH only (or Denmark debit card) Give it a try if you need an american food fix!","40"
"PuterDude","We came late in the evening to Banana Joe's shop. He still welcomed us in, and made us feel as if we were at his home. We have been to several places we will be writing reviews for on our trip, and my plan is to review them all once I return home, but I simply could not wait to write something on this place's behalf. The burgers were a conglomeration of flavors and ingredients that served to make my mouth happy and my hands messy.  All of this at a price that was nothing compared to the other restaurants of comparable and lesser quality.  The ownership of this restaurant clearly knows the value of good service, good treatment of customers, and good food. This was our last night in Copenhagen and I can't think of a better ambassador to give us one last bit of hygge for our visit.  Note: If you're there at breakfast, you might just find some crepe options - we saw a sign.  The bottom line is, if you want to go to a place you will want to return to again and again because you are welcomed, appreciated and can afford to, go to Banana Joe's.","50"

We let Joe choose the burgers for us and were so glad we did! So tasty and fresh. Food that makes you smile. Joe chatted with us and treated us well. This is what he loves to do, and it shows. If I lived here I would definitely be a regular. We highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed, and Joe himself is worth the trip. The food is a delightful bonus! Joe is a good man who can make great burgers. Happy to have had the pleasure of eating there.","50"
"Peter H","Went here based off the very positive reviews.  The place is fairly easy to find on Elmegade close to the Nørrebro disco area with Barcelona, mexibar etc. close by. The owner is very friendly - lots of people walking by waved or said hello.  The burgers are decently sized - and are what I would define as in the low price range - but still very tasty. They are though in a different class (and price range) compared with 100+ DKK cafe burgers. But the place has lots of charm and is worth a visit.  I had the Banana Joe special with an egg - and some fries. We sat at some of the tables outside.","40"
"VirtualWayfarer","Banana Joe's has been my go-to burger place in Copenhagen for just under three years. I'm a burger guy through and through, and have been known to opt for a burger for both lunch and then later for dinner on multiple occasions. So, in a burger I'm looking for something that is reasonably priced, filling, has high quality meat, is a bit messy, and full of flavor. The burgers here strike that balance better than anyone else in Copenhagen. Particularly Joe's special burger (the one with the egg on top).   Even though it is tempting to stick exclusively with one of Joe's special burgers, I highly suggest folks work their way through all his burgers. The chicken burger is always properly cooked and full of taste while the fish burger uses real slices of fish (salmon) that is cooked better than most of the ""fine dining"" restaurants around town.   Banana Joe's is a one man operation and at the heart of it the owner is a vibrant character with a huge smile and wonderful personality. He's the type of guy who treats everyone like family, especially if you skip ordering your burger to-go and enjoy it on the spot. It's obvious he cares about the food and that you enjoy his meals and I think that, as much as just how good the food is, is part of the reason I've continued to be eat at Joe's on a weekly basis for the last three years. He's always great, the food is fantastic, and because he's always the one on the grill the quality and experience has always been reliable.  The key to getting the most out of a visit to Joe's is to remember that this is a one-man operation, and one of Copenhagen's treasures. It's a small hole in the wall restaurant (for those who know the term) with a couple of chairs inside, and another 5 tables out along the street if the weather is good. Remember, this isn't McDonalds and the burgers are cooked fresh which can take a little bit longer, especially if it's a busy night, but which is always well worth it. So, settle in, relax, ask Joe for a recommendation if you're feeling indecisive or open minded, and feel free to strike up a conversation with the other people there.","50"

"Rachel R","Banana Joe was the best AND cheapest meal we had in Copenhagen. The special burger and salmon burger are both an excellent value, filling, flavorful, and incredibly delicious. Quality is apparent at Joe's, and that includes service. Joe was the kindest person my friends and I met during our time in Copenhagen, and you should definitely pay him a visit (or four... like we did.) Don't miss the best burger you'll have in Copenhagen - it costs less than water in some restaurants!","50"

"Jillmarsco","Don't be put off by how small this place is. We had a tough time finding it (take the 5A bus from Norreport metro station and get off at Elmegade stop. Walk a block and a half, it's on your right). Well worth the effort. Our group ordered burgers and one salmon burger. They were all delicious and more food than we could eat. When we told the owner we had such a time finding his place he made us a side of his chicken in special sauce and then served us little frozen ices. Good food at a reasonable price is always a good combination!","40"
"Bingheng","My partner and I had the best meal in all of Copenhagen here, and we aren't even really burger people. Would have came back, but we were due to fly out the next evening.  Mr Banana Joe has found the secret to running a dining establishment - treat the food as sacred, and love your customers as you would your guests. Before I even begin, the salmon burger we had was good enough to warrant a revisit.  Being students, we opted to share a burger with a side of fries to save some money. Mr Joe for some inexplicable reason decided to split the meat into two burgers, each with a portion of fries, salad and much more. This led to a conversation, we shared our life stories (his was infinitely more exciting - see if you can get him to warm up and share), he popped two cans of coke on the house, and 2 hours later, we left, only because he needed to close up for the night.  We came in as curious tourists, we left with a friend 10000 miles from home (whom we have to invite to our wedding now). Couldn't ask for more.","50"
"fabrizio830","The owner of the place itself is worth the money. Very friendly and nice person. The food is cheap and very well cooked, especially the salmon burger. Dont miss the banana joe special sauce. A must try","50"
"Peter Y","Joe's burger is one of the best burger I have eaten. As I watched how he cooked his food, you know that he cooks them with love. Just like the way he treats his customers. He sacrificed his once big restaurant to share his love...More","50"
"WingFong","We were in Copenhagen for two days after a cruise and wanted to give Noma (named ""world's best restaurant"" by Restaurant magazine) a try. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a reservation. So we decided to try the best burger in Copenhagen instead. Banana Joe didn't disappoint! We had gourmet burgers in the states before, this is undoubtedly the top 1 or 2 we tried.   We ordered a chicken burger and the Banana Joe special burger. The meat was fresh and prepared by Joe after we ordered. Both burgers were moist and juicy. The Banana Joe burger came with beef patty and fried egg. We loved both. Joe's secret sauce was amazing! Too bad he won't give us his recipe.  Joe is so warm and friendly to his customers. He makes you feel like you're a friend visiting from out of town. Even though he is very busy, he'd still made time to talk to you. You can tell he enjoys his work. This is absolutely our most memorable experience in Copenhagen.","50"

"namyee","I was with family and friends visiting Copenhagen. Before the trip, we looked up where to eat at Trip Advisor and Yelp. Both sites have high rating on Banana Joe. On our last day at Copenhagen, we thought we give it a try since it is just a 10 minutes walk from where we stayed.  Although the place is small and there are tables outside the restaurant, but the restaurant is clean and cozy. To our surprise. the owner does it all. He took our orders, he cooked, he cleaned and he served.   We ordered a burger (I forgot the name but it came with a fried egg) and a chicken burger. They were sooooo good. Chicken was moist and the sauce on both burgers were just unbelievable. One of our friends asked for the sauce recipe. Joe said it is his secret recipe.   Joe took time and have a chat with us. His English was good and he is funny too. He is a hard working honest man. We all very happy that we went there and have such a wonderful meal.  I highly recommend this place. It is a burger place but these are extraordinary burgers. Try it and you wouldn't be disappointed.","50"
"Pi W","Husband and I were in Copenhagen in early May, and we'd read the reviews about Banana Joe's. Charmed by them, we decided to cross half the town from our hotel to eat there (but mostly to meet 'Joe'!). The burgers were enormous, everything was fresh, and because I couldn't finish my meal, Joe wrapped the rest up for me. There were even complementary meat kebab things. My husband was stoked with the meal -he likes good honest food. Joe then chatted to us for quite a while; he's like having an instant friend in Copenhagen, or a family member. The whole meal was supercheap as well. Also: I'm pregnant and I got him to guess the gender of our baby. He was right (it's a boy!). So if you're pregnant and need someone to predict the gender, head down to Banana Joe's!","50"
"capkov","I it hadn't been for a friends recommendation, I might as well have walked past Banana Joe's. Pretty good I didn't though, otherwise I would have missed out on the best burger experience I ever had. Ok, I am not a burger conosseur and have therefore not had that many, but Joe's burger maneuvred itself on top of that modest list. I mean, would you expect a really delicious piece of salmon filet on a fishburger? I didn't. And it was aweseome.  Also Joe himself manages to make you feel like a guest in his house. He is a sociable guy who obviously loves what he's doing and is dedicated to give you the best expericene possible. And that for a VERY reasonable price. He even gave us a free Faxe Kondi, because he thought it to be a more appropriate drink than the water we ordered.  All in all, if there is any burger place I would recommend, it's this. Even if you're just in town for a short while, don't miss out on Banana Joe's!","50"
"Aniii331","A small place in the middle of charming area Norrebro with great burgers. Decent portions, good quality of meat served with lots of fresh vegetables and delicious sauce. Also the owner is so pleasant and hospitable. And the best thing is price. Just unbelievably that you can eat a delicious meal in Copenhagen and not go bankrupt :-) Banana Joe should be an example to other food places in Copenhagen, cause it shows that there's no need for overpricing.  Definitely recommended. Can't wait to go again.","50"
"Sid K","Joe is a genuine and hospitable proprietor of his restaurant. While the size of the place is modest (best for take away unless it's a couple of you), his food is as big as his personality and heart. One of us was on the fence between the fresh fish burger and the cheeseburger. He gave her a free ""sample"" which actually was nearly the size of an entire burger! We came in at dinner time with 7 of us and he had the entire order done in 10 minutes, even with a couple change requests after our initial order. His burgers are really as good as the reviews say they are. Fries are a must as well. He even gave us a free coke to wash them down with. While handling payment for our order, he conversed with us personally in 3 different languages. I felt like he was welcoming us in his home. If you don't make your way here at least once, you're missing out on a gem of a restaurant.","50"
"Ginsoakedboy21","Found out about Banana Joe's on the internet when we were looking for somewhere cheap to grab a bite to eat in Copenhagen. This place is very small, (it's a counter and two small tables, that's all) and totally unremarkable to look at. But the burgers are excellent (If very sloppy - you will make a mess) and the portions of fries were enormous. (We tried to order two and 'Joe' suggested we share one - he was right) And ah yes, Joe, the proprieter... he is why this place is getting a cult following - super friendly, (speaks good English too) very funny, and really cares about the food. He brought the raw salmon fillets out for my girlfriend's burger before he made it to show us how fresh they were. You don't get that in most take aways! Do yourself a favour, drop in and have a burger here if you are in Copenhagen,","50"

"KurtG399","I came across Banana Joes on this site when looking for a burger place in Copenhagen that wouldn't cost me $25-40. I'm glad I did, not only is the food fresh and beautifully cooked, the portion size is big and service is wonderful. The owner/chef is a stand up guy who is genuinely interested in the people that come in and is a great conversationalist. I went 2 nights in a row. If I'm back in Copenhagen I'll be eating at Banana Joes ","50"
"georgewalley","I eat out regularly due to frequently travelling for work but this is the first restaurant that has made me want to leave a review.  The chef/owner/waiter is top notch, he is a genuinely nice guy who goes out of his way to ensure the meal is to your liking.  The menu is all in Danish but fear not the owner will explain it to you and make recommendations if you wish!  I had a large cheese burger which came with chips and all the trimmings, it was lovely, I don't think I have had a better burger! The meal came to 48 Krona which is roughly £5. Food is fairly pricy in Copenhagen, I feel this is good value for the area.  I will be going back when I return to Copenhagen, I recommend you try this hidden gem for yourself.","50"
"Lisa D","Banana Joe's is my favourite place to go for a decently priced burger in Copenhagen. My friends and I make regular treks to this hole in the wall in Nørrebro to get a little taste of home (i.e. North American style burgers). The guy who runs the place is great, friendly, and always wants to make sure you are satisfied with the meal. Make sure you don't go too early though - it doesn't open until 5pm!","50"
"Stephi899","We went on a hunt for Banana Joe's on the last day of our trip to Copenhagen after reading plenty of reviews online claiming it to be the home of the ""best burger in town"", and it did not dissappoint. It is a small place run by one man, who really knows the values of outstanding customer service. When we found it, we were puzzling over the menu (all in Danish) and then asked him what he would recommend. He made us the Banana Joe burger with fries, and even made some chicken for us to try as well, which i would definitely opt for if we ever return to Denmark :D  The owner knows that tourists can find the prices to eat out in Copenhagen on the steep side, and offers top quality food at an affordable price. The warmth and banter shown by the owner alone makes this place worth a visit, many peole were stopping in while we sat and ate our food, it seems like he is a well liked member of the community with a loyal following.  Not to be missed!","50"
"JordiJo","I ate here twice during my week in Copenhagen, because this really is one of the best places to eat burger and meat in the city. It's located in multicultural, lively and safe at the same time neighborhood Norrebro, 15 minutes walking from the city center. The restaurant is small, really quiet and you can eat inside or outside at tables on the street. Food quality is excellent, cooked on the moment and quickly by the only cook/waiter/owner, which is a beautiful person, really kind and friendly. Prices are really cheap for Copenaghen standard, and it's open untill 10 PM. It's possible to pay only with danish credit card or danish crowns. I suggest to taste the delicious grill mix!  Special thanks to the owner ""Banana Joe"" who really made us feal home.","50"
