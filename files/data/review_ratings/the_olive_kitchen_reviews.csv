"Pkopi","we were the first time in CPH and also first time in Olive. Great Service and cooking - and it was so nice to have an Waiter who speaks german. Our EN is not so good to understand the menu! It was everything great - BUT - All this were the reason that we want to come again. NO way to get a booking in the evening for the next two days (before we have to leave)","50"
"JBH2015","We ate here on our final night and it turned out to be our favorite meal. Veronica was our server and she was great. The mussels were delicious but the rib appetizer was the best. Fall off the bone ribs cooked overnight. The peppercorn steak entree was delicious, the meat was very tender. Overall it was an excellent experience.","50"
"jelkberk","Our server Veronica transformed a tasty meal into a memorable experience. She was genuinely friendly and thoughtful, and spent extra time after our meal sharing her thoughts about her favorite places to visit in the area. The restaurant has a welcoming vibe supported by delicious food (we sampled the duck confit and seared salmon) at reasonable prices.","50"
"maren h","I can highly recommend this restaurant. The service and food was outstanding. Our waitress answered all the questioned about the menu and was very friendly. The food was amazing. The Salmon Tartar appetizer was so good, so were the mussels. They have plenty of other dishes if you don't like seafood. I would go back on my next trip to Copenhagen.","50"
"TampaRunner13","The food here was absolutely amazing. Our favorite in Copenhagen. My salmon was incredible and my husband's duck the most succulent. This is a very popular spot so make a reservation.","50"

"dhollier_57","This was a fabulous place from cocktails to the last sip of wine! Mushroom soup: yummmmmm! Salmon dish? Double yummmmm! Wait staff and overall service? Does not get any better. I said I wanted to marry the chef, but they said I’d probably only get part of his arm. This place is a must! Better reserve if you want to try it!","50"

We enjoyed the duck and salmon fish, as well as the perfect medium steak.","50"
"LadyLinda05","I read lots of reviews before our first visit to Copenhagen, this restaurant seemed to be popular so on our second night we tried it. What a treat, great atmosphere, lovely friendly staff and brilliant food. We shared a salmon tartar starter followed by a duck confit and panko chicken mains, all delicious. The wine was good too. Altogether great experience on a chilly night wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and would visit again in a heartbeat.","50"

"mottie178","After reading the reviews I booked this restaurant for my wife’s birthday. It didn’t disappoint. The manager was very accommodating and looked after us well. The waiter was there just the right amount. The food came quickly, which was excellent. The best pork loin I ever had. We thought it was good value, after trying others that were much more expensive and not a patch on this one. Thank you The Olive Kitchen. Highly recommended.","50"
"travel4646","An excellent meal and reasonable in Copenhagen. We visited with both younger children and grandparents and everyone enjoyed everything that ate. The duck was on of the best I have ever had. The service was lovely as well. A definite must!","50"

We had the four course tastier menu with accompanying wines & port which consisted of Salmon Tartar, Mushroom Soup, Steak with a peppercorn sauce & Panna Cotta they were all very tasty & beautiful presented.  The decor is modern with a lot traditional wood features & there is a busy atmosphere.   I definitely would eat here again !   ","50"

"gingergleds","Had this place recommended by two different people before we visited Copenhagen. So with recommendations like that we felt compelled to book. The Copenhagen trip was for mine and my wives 10th wedding anniversary and the glass of Cava on arrival was a great touch (thank you). The menu is fairly small but the food on there was amazing. Salmon Tartar, Flank Steak and Cheese were truly stunning. The steak was devine, just melted in your mouth. The blue cheese mousse was superb great taste and a very unique texture. If we ever go back to Copenhagen we will have to visit The Olive Kitchen again.","40"

"Angela Y","We booked a table several days in advance and it’s a booking at 1930. We were only late for 16 minutes, merely one minute later than the 15 minutes grace period stipulated. And they gave the table away. They didn’t even try calling when we’re late. It’s simply unbelievable! Even the manager here admitted this was bad service! We walked 30 minutes in the cold! People don’t go to this restaurant. Extremely disappointing!","10"
"sander1900","This is the best restaurant we went to during our stay in Copenhagen! The food tasted very good, staff is friendly and the atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice as well. Price is higher then we are used to outside the Scandinavian countries, but worth it when eating here. The bottles of wine are very reasonably priced! The only improvement would be to have a little bit more time between the courses. Book ahead...!","50"
"888henrikl","The food is really no nonsense and simple, but VERY good. Price for the food is very reasonable, and a wine menu to go with the food is cheap, but good. Remember to book in advance.","50"

"walvis32","The restaurant is rather dark - thought it was closed when I entered it - and looks a bit old and gloomy. I first had mushroom soup: it tasted great. the bread was also great. Then I had salmon with vegetables. The salmon was dry, the sauce was so so, vegetables great. Dessert was chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake was lovely, ice cream nothing special. All-in all it was not bad, but when eating out, in Copenhagen one expects something great.","30"
"Marco M","Customer care is definitely there, without being too oppressive. You feel at easy, you eat at the pace you want. Relaxed. Food was quite good - the ""confit"" was just perfect. I picked it after having read about many restaurants in Copenhagen as I wanted something up to the level our weekend deserved. I agree with the absolute majority of 5 stars. Only thing I would improve: wine selection. Not more wines, that would be against the concept (a few menu items, but top notch). Just wines with more character than an american standard mid end pinot - I understand it could be an issue but that is what I personally think, with no pretension of teaching them anything as they obviously know their job very very well.","50"
"Chris H","One of the best meals of our trip. We started with the Blue Mussels which were some of the freshest I have ever had. We followed it up with the seasonal risotto and duck confit both of which were perfectly prepared. They had nice selection of drinks and craft cocktails that were very unique.","50"
"NEM89","We visited Copenhagen for the weekend and went to two places for dinner, this being one of them. It was definitely an underwhelming experience! The food was good, but not amazing (perhaps not to our taste?) and the atmosphere was fine, but neither romantic nor buzzy. It made for a fine dinner, but nothing special. The staff were outstanding though, very friendly and chatty.","30"
"stephb585","We went to celebrate a birthday, and we’re just amazed at the overall experience. Friendly staff, amazing food and a great overall ambience of the restaurant. They even made a mocktail version of the adults drink for the one child at the dinner!   Would highly recommended and would definitely return!!","50"
"Peterrh58","Some friends did recommend this restaurent and we was not dissapointed. Had booked a table ( a good idea ) and got our table, friendly staff , good time to decide what to have, easy manu card with a possiblity to select between chicken, pork, beef, fish in both starters and main course and same pricing- smart and simple. Prices really affordable , we was 4 persons and a total cost for us was DKK 1700, actaully cheap when you compare wiht the quality of food served, wine card small, but fine. We will have to get back again - no doubt about that.","50"
"NN-CPH","My third visit to this restaurant, and not my last! The tasty and delicious food, the good wines to accompany it, the relaxing atmosphere so well supported by the accomodating yet efficient staff together with the good company I brought myself summed up to a great evening. The high standard I came back for is still there.  We had three courses - a la carte but there is also a 4-courses menu at a fixed price and you can add a wine menu, both at very reasonable prices - and we had salmon, chicken, duck, panna cotta. All to our satisfaction.","50"
"urbanetraveler","We so enjoyed the dining experience at the Olive Kitchen & Bar. The food was delicious, as was the wine. It is a small, simple and casual restaurant with a local feel. Do order their molten chocolate cake. It was worth the calories!","50"
"Kelly C","We visited here after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and so glad we did. Family run, cosy and welcoming. A small but good menu. The food and service were excellent. You will need to book though. Cost us around £95 for 2 courses each and 2 large wines.","50"
"LexCH16","I’ve booked a table in this restaurant well ahead of our trip based on Tripadvisor reviews and therefore had high expectations. To summarise it upfront, they were met in every aspect!  Starting with the atmosphere, the interior is simple but feels cosy. The staff is young but very attentive and friendly. The food is simply excellent although the menu is not too extensive but there’s something on for everyone. They split the menu in starter, main course and dessert with all the meals per course costing the same (attractively priced in my view for the high quality food and level of detail you get for it).   Based on our very positive experience we spontaneously decided to go back to the same restaurant the evening after. We had no reservation the second night but were lucky as someone else had a no-show. To our surprise the staff recognized us and greeted us cheerfully.   Recommend the salmon tartar or spare ribs as a starter, the steak with a very delicious pepper sauce as main course and the cheese platter for dessert.   Highly recommend this place for a very good experience in Copenhagen.","50"
"Lingoh88","Really enjoyed our night at The Olive kitchen n bar. We were warmly welcomed into the restaurant we free champs on the house for our table not being ready for our booking. Not a problem!   I have to applaud the Service of this team, amazing, it really does complete the dining experience.   Food...one word “AMAZING”. Quality food cooked to perfection. We ordered the mushroom soup, YUM! Pork ribs, YUM! they even give u gloves, so u get dig in! Mussels, YUM! Steak, YUM! Pannacotta, sooo good!!  We understand why this restaurant is so highly rated on tripadvisor, it really does live up to expectations. Chef still manages to handle the quality of the food even with full house! Remember to make a booking, this place was packed, our booking wasn’t until 9.30pm. So book to not miss out!","50"

"LarruZ","We had found this restaurant on Tripadvisor and now we know why it has the second place of all restaurants in Copenhagen. We were smart enough to book the restaurant in advance, because, even though it was Jan 2, the place was packed! And for a good reason obviously:  The entourage, the service and, most importantly, the food was absolute very good!   We really enjoyed our stay here and we will definitely come back when we are in Copenhagen again. This place is a definite go-to when in Denmark!","50"
"454dimitrism","We visit this restaurant the last night in Copenhagen and it was really amazing. We was a little bit late but the staff was very helpful and friendly. The prices are the same in all restaurants in Copenhagen","40"
"55alexandrem","We went to this restaurant following the site’s numerous recommendations, and it was fantastic. Very friendly staff, smiling and caring, nice atmosphere. Menu is quite simple, just a few dishes to chose from, but is just enough. Between us and the kids, we tried a big part of the menu and everything was fresh, well prepared, amazingly good. If I could make one recommendation, don’t miss the mushroom soup!!! Good choice of simple wines as well, from various locations.   Book in advance, the place looks packed all the time!","50"
"Tforfood","We hand mussels and ribs for starters, chicken and duck for mains. All were absolutely delicious and portions were generous. The service was excellent and friendly.  Extra plus for giving rubber gloves with the ribs, keeping your hands clean while eating finger food. The bill was also very reasonable for the overall experience, 820dkk for 2 glasses of wine, water, 2 starters, 2 mains and drinks for dessert.","50"
"leonardmj","Again another cosy restaurant, Copenhagen does this so well.  Mega Gin + Tonica - staff were great detailing the menu and wine options, service was friendly. Main courses are a good size - although no desert was sampled as we were stuffed after the main course. Will go again when hungry..","40"
"advisoryGuy","This place easily deserves 5 stars. It was the best dinner we had in Copenhagen. Considering all the other ridiculously expensive restaurants, this is a perfect choice. I especially loved the mushroom soup and the chocolate dessert.","50"
"Ray B","We booked 3 weeks in advance for a Friday night. ON the night so many potential diners were turned away at the door and on the phone. The young lady (Scots) at front of house was excellent. The food was basic but very very good.","50"
"samtL1572WE","I love the romantic vibes of the place. They make a dang good gin & tonic. My husband and I did a tasting menu that was so tasty! I was surprised that one of my most favorite courses was the mushroom soup but honestly I loved it all. I liked that the dessert was not chocolate and it was something light with fruit and beautiful rose gold flakes! It was seriously so pretty. The food portions were perfect for us. We were full but not weighed down so in my opinion that’s a perfect meal! I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that just loves real and delicious food! I also love the sign on the wall when you first walks in. It says eat more of what makes you happy!","50"

"antotus","The restaurant is intimate and cozy with a young, kind and friendly staff. Food definitely good and well presented. We had Norwegian Salmon Tartar and Creamy Mushroom soup for starters, than Pan Seared Salmon Filet and Duck Confit for main courses. Two beers and no desert for a 750 DKK bill. Overall war a really nice dinner, one of the best in Copenhagen","50"
"405pams","We stopped in here without reservations on a Friday night right when they opened. We were lucky to get a table as the place was fully booked for the rest of the evening. The food was well presented and very good. They offer a tasting menu which we did not order but which looked enticing. The salmon and steak were excellent as were the Copenhagen rib appetizer. This was our first meal in Copenhagen and we were not disappointed. We would definitely visit again. The staff were very attentive and friendly as well. Good cocktails also!","50"
"CE-1410","We were staying at Axel Guldsmeden so about a 20min walk but for my partners 40th birthday we were so pleased we booked here (which I did weeks in advance & I would recommend everyone books as it’s so busy). Warm friendly welcome from Hannah our waitress along with another member of staff & we were seated in a lovely warm lit restaurant. Menus given, drinks ordered (free glass of fizz each for the birthday boy) food decided - Ribs, Mushroom soup, Steak & Duck. Everything was amazing, best mushroom soup I have ever tasted & the steak just melted in your mouth. Far too full for pudding much to Hannah’s disappointment as she wanted to put a sparkler in my partners birthday pud we opted for the bill. So 2 starters, 2 mains & a beer or came to about £70. Hannah is fab at explaining conversion & if you want to tip.  Would recommend & go back. Yum yum","50"
"jarborra","We were staying at the nearby Skt Petri hotel and were looking for somewhere to eat a late Sunday dinner. The hotel restaurant was sad and empty as expected so this was a surprise recommendation by the concierge. It is literally around the corner and, with a bit of mental arithmetic by Hanna (the lovely hostess) we were seated. The place was packed at 9pm on a Sunday!!   The menu is short and simple but surprisingly well priced. My colleague had the duck confit and I had the peppercorn steak and both were excellent and arrived quickly. The steak was perfectly cooked and it was a surprisingly large portion (see pic) for a modest 175 DKK.   The service was friendly and, despite being Swedes, we were allowed to speak English. I’ll definitely make the Olive Kitchen a regular spot whenever I’m in town!","50"

"Lazzagear","This must be one of the best restaurants in Copenhagen. The menu is small but all courses were absolutely on point, both in terms of presentation and flavour. All wines are offered by the bottle or glass, which is perfect when one of you wants white and one wants red. The service was also excellent and the ambiance is warm and inviting. Highly recommended.","50"

"FWils68z","A friend of mine booked a table for me as she was highly recommended it, but when the day has come I didn't want to go as I was afraid that I'll have to eat too much again (a small person eating alone in a restaurant has always been a problem as the potions never fits my size). However, I'm glad that I did made my way to the restaurant.  The mussel soup was very nice but the salmon dish was superb. As an Australian I've always preferred Tasmanian salmon as I found Norway salmon has a stronger taste and smell. But The Olive nailed it. They cooked the salmon so perfectly that i didn't feel i was eating Norwegian salmon. They even asked how would I want it cooked like you would get asked when ordering a steak. I prefer eating my salmon quite raw as that's how I know the freshness of the fish and The Olive was confident enough to make me one. The sauce was also very nice. I'm not a sauce person but I throughly enjoyed the sauce too.  Portion was perfect even the dish size was brilliant. Often I got to a restaurant and food was served on a huge plate that everyone was struggling to fit everything on the table, but The Olive has chosen their plates wisely that reduced hassle for both waiting person and customers keep rearranging plates for space. Service was great, everyone was so friendly and smiley, but Will was a gem. I don't normally do tips but I had to tip them for their great job and nice food.   If you are interested trying here out you really need to book a table. I saw many people were turned away without a reservation.","50"
"B95127","After dining at some notable Copenhagen restaurants, the olive kitchen and bar was a nice change and solid choice. Very affordable 4 course tasting menu with wines for 595 Danish kroner which is approximately $85 US. Very reasonably priced meal and nice quality. The best part about this place was the staff. Every staff member was charming,friendly and helpful. The staff gets five stars, the food gets four stars","40"
"UK_DuchessDevon","Went here for a special occasion and had the taster menu with wine.  The food was awesome, I had the best mushroom soup ever! The staff were attentive and took the trouble to explain each dish and the accompanying wine. All the food was cooked perfectly and presented well. The only tiny gripe was horrible Americano coffee. £135 for two is pretty good value for four courses and wine in an expensive city. Booked online prior to travel.","50"
"fifmou","We arrived on a rainy evening without a booking but as it was early they squeezed us in. We didn't feel rushed and stayed for dessert. Food was impeccably cooked, good selection of wine too and nice staff and atmosphere. Fairly pricey meal with wine but worth the money for a special occasion, but not every day dining. Was able to get gluten free without any fuss.","50"

Recommend this small gem for people in Copenhagen.","50"

It is a romantically lit, cosy place and is a hidden gem. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, prompt but not intrusive, The food was very good as was the accompanying wine. We had the fixed menu with wine pairing. I especially like the mushroom soup which was delicious. The portion sizes were just right to leave you nicely full without feeling stuffed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Copenhagen.","40"
"markg10101","We arrived without a reservation, so were offered a table if we could leave by 8pm. The staff were very friendly and efficient without rushing us.   The food was good, but not great, I had the peppercorn streak which was good but the sauce lacked punch. ","50"

"Casualtraveler99","We did not have a reservation and we had 7 people to cram into a small restaurant on a summer Saturday night. I stopped by the day before. They checked carefully and had no room. But as we talked, someone must have cancelled. The hostess quickly put us in for 6:30 but informed us we would need to leave at 8:30 because another group had reserved the table. I said sure, we can finish in two hours. We came back the next night, they had the table ready to go, and at 8:30 they reminded me of what I had promised. Happy to comply. So, great service, the food was very good, and the price -- for Copenhagen -- was excellent. I highly recommend this fine restaurant.","50"

Highlights included the chicken parmigiana and the “self saving biscuit” dessert.  Great meal, thoughtfully prepared food, great service. Thanks for a great first night in Copenhagen. ","50"

After nights of dinner price sticker shock in Reykjavik and previous dinners in Copenhagen, a nice surprise to see such a reasonably priced menu and wine list. It was a b-day dinner that the staff found out about during our stay and champagne all around on the house and our creme brûlée had candles and a Danish flag. Highly recommended.","50"
"ilonam509","Booked a table through a very easy online booking system. In the comments I wrote that it was a birthday dinner. The staff welcomed us with a smile and showed us to a table with a little Danish flag on it (that's the Danish birthday decoration) and brought us two glasses of cava.  We had the set 4-course menu with wine. Everything tasted delicious! The salmon tartar starter was my personal favourite. The booking was for 2 hours 15 minutes, but we spent there way over 3 hours also enjoying some extra glasses of the delicious red wine before the dessert. The service was top notch throughout, and the staff was very knowledgable about the wine and the food. The 4 course menu with wine was a bit over 500kr which i think was a very good value for money.  Would highly recommend.","50"
"spirosz171","Three stars may be a little harsh as the food was not bad but we went there because of the high rating and expectations were not met. In fact, my beef fillet was quite tasty and my girlfriend's chicken dish although nothing special, it was above average (I thought so but she hated it).  Sadly the portions were tiny and we left the place still hungry.  My review should be closer to 4 stars but I felt that 3 stars were needed to compensate for the overall overrated score.","30"

Everything was very delicious. The waitresses were very friendly.   The atmosphere is very welcoming and cozy, yet stylish. The plates, bowls etc. are beautiful and cater exactly to my likings.   I asked for lactose-free milk in my coffee but they didn’t have any, which was a bummer, tho. I’d expect a modern restaurant nowadays to at least have lactose-free milk, since lactose intolerance is not rare.   Anyways, I’d still recommend the restaurant and I will be happy to come back and try more dishes next time we’re in Copenhagen.","50"

No wonder you won't get a table without reservation....","50"
"yiannos_aletraris","If I need to choose one thing I remember from this place is its friendly staff ! The warmest welcome, full description of every dish served, and everyone with a smile !. We tried to visit, again based on Tripadvisor ratings, but it was full booked, so we were fortunate to find a slot online for the next day. The menu is limited, which is expected for a restaurant of this kind, but well thought of. We all had the mushroom soup for starters, and then tastes differed - salmon, steak and chicken. To end the night two of the family members went for the creme brulee. If I had to rate them - I would say that the starter and the desert scored highest, with the main dishes being close but needing someting more ... Pricewise, usual Copenhagen high prices - 200 euro for a family of 4 is not a cheap meal, but well worth the experience !","50"
"tatianskaia","we arrived and there was no one greeting us, so we picked up a table and then an unfeiendly lady with unnaturally happy voice jumped in and told it was all booked and we were supposed to wait for her and read sign. i generally do this everywhere, but here it was all so rude I don't recommend it.","10"

"Kim00","I want to echo all the reviews of this restaurant: great food, service and charming ambience. The food was terrific: it is rare when we go to a restaurant and virtually everything on the menu is something both of us would like to order and we have a hard time choosing from many great choices. We settled on the mushroom soup, risotto of the day and salmon tartar. All outstanding and with a really interesting mix of fresh ingredients. Definitely don’t miss this restaurant when you are in Copenhagen. And the service was excellent too!","50"
"James W","We showed up here, early, on a weekday night, and they were able to seat us right away, even though we didn't have a reservation.

Our waitress was really friendly, and service was quick and efficient. It really made for a memorable dining experience!","50"

"0isaaca","We stopped in here as part of a food tour, and were told going in that it was one of the finest restaurants in Copenhagen, and we were not disappointed. We had a lovely glass of wine and a dinner of salmon and vegetables, and it was all terrific.  As it was hot and we were doing a walking tour, we were hardly dressed for a nice sit-down dinner, but pleasantly, it was as down-to-earth an environment as you could hope for. The waiter was friendly, and the food was great. I only wish that I had the chance to return for a full meal.","50"
"christinaz514","We visited the restaurant based on the great reviews regarding the food & the location. We did not had the best meal ever... main courses were too complicated & big, many elements mixed together. Cocktails were nice so was the salad!  Staff was really friendly, maybe more than required. The decoration of the restaurant is plain especially near the front windows. The food was served on a really small table, in small dishes (based on the amount of the food) and without any sous plat or table cloth.","30"
"michaelmR6524VA","We went with another couple and had a fantastic time. It’s pretty popular so you generally need a reservation. The food choices are varied but limited in number. Nevertheless, everything was fantastic. The service is good and the servers are friendly. The great reviews offered here are definitely accurate. This is the best meal I’ve had in 5 days in Copenhagen.","50"
"P9275TApetert","My wife & I enjoyed our meal at the Olive. Service was excellent, provided by an engaging multilingual woman. Portions were large by European standards and food was quite good. The menu is limited so make sure you can find something you would like to eat before you go. I can't imagine this is the fourth best restaurant in Copenhagen, as it is currently rated on TA, but it was very good.","40"
"Susanellen26","We had a wonderful dinner here . I had a chicken dish and my friend had a fabulous pork dinner. The ambiance is charming too. This is a very popular place for couples so be sure to get a reservation first. I saw a number of people turned away as the restaurant was booked.","50"
"sandi b","The restaurant had a low key trendy vibe. Our server was delightful. At the end of our dinner we chatted briefly and she recommended places to see in Copenhagen. Our dinner was really delicious. I had seared salmon and my husband had panko crusted chicken. It was reasonably priced by Copenhagen standards. We’d highly recommend it.","50"
"Robert58213","My family and I visited The Olive after a long day of touring Copenhagen. We made a reservation online, and our table was waiting as promised when we arrived. We each had steak, which was cooked to absolute perfection; and my daughter had mushroom soup, which I tried and can say was magnificent. The service was prompt and friendly, and the setting was at once rustic and chic. All told, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to The Olive.","50"
"Judy D","I had the veal ribs to start and they were fabulous. They give you gloves to wear while you eat them so you don't get messy. The wait staff described each dish as it was served. This was described as ""cooked in beef broth with salt and pepper lightly added after to enhance the taste."" It tasted really good. May be the best thing I had in the two weeks we were traveling and we had a lot of good food. My friends and husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the chicken. We got the ""self saucing chocolate biscuit"" which turned out to be lava cake with bourbon vanilla ice cream. It got 4 of 4 moans for goodness. Google maps had trouble finding the place. My husband said it's because the town is old that you really have to pay attention because sometimes the map is saying to go a little to the right then turn left and it's easy to miss that. I found the cost for the 4 of us to be reasonable. We did make reservations. It's not that large a restaurant so if you want to eat there, you should plan ahead.","50"
"W8150HAlucyh","We could not have asked for better food. I had the pork and my partner had the steak, which were both incredible. I would highly recommend it, best meal we’ve had in a while. The service was also fantastic and the atmosphere was friendly.","50"
"558DavidA558","Arrived without a reservation and were accommodated very well Initially we were seated at a table near the front door as it was the only one available however not long after we had our drink order arrive we were offered a better table even though we had been happy to take any table as we hadn’t booked. A nice unsolicited gesture Both the manager and the waitress we had were excellent, very friendly and very knowledgeable about the food  We had soup and ribs for entree and both were very good. Salmon for main course and they asked how we wanted it cooked and then cooked it to perfection.  Not sure about the pea purée as an accompaniment to the salmon but all in all a very good meal Thank You","50"
"RonanP45","This restaurant amazed me. We were a party of eleven, and every one of us loved the food. It is a simple, unpretentious setting, and given that Copenhagen is an extremely expensive city, it was reasonably priced.  Everything was cooked to perfection. The starters were glorious, and the main courses were absolutely delicious. The service was efficient without being obtrusive, each dish had some unusual and delightful touch, and the staff are obviously, (and rightly!) proud of the food. There is a short menu, but every single dish we tried was excellent. The only reason we didn't have dessert was because we were so full aft4er the first two courses. A special meal, in the end about £40 a head including wine. Excellent value.","50"
"danieldavidsydney","One of the best dinners I have ever had! I was searching trip advisor for a place to eat with my wife on our first night and thank god I found this place and checked trip advisor. The staff were so friendly and the food was sensational! What a great experience from beginning to the end. I Would highly recommend it for anyone staying in Copenhagen.","50"
"TerriM152","We dined here on our last evening in town, and it was the best meal we had in Copenhagen. The salmon was terrific, as was the special risotto. The wine list is small, but has some good choices. Skip the “foodie” places and come here instead for a fine meal.","50"
"ThomasHuang72","The food was fine, but service was terrible. We had made the reservation in advance but came up with a narrow space which was near the toilet when there were plenty available tables. We asked for recommendation but the servant never answered the question. Never cleaned the table or served the water The arrogant attitude and discrimination were just unacceptable.  食物本身沒問題，但服務生的態度真的糟透了，即時很早之前就預約，卻給了我們一個廁所旁而且空間狹窄的位置。當時明明旁邊還有許多有空的位置。問些推薦菜色也不回答，態度輕忽轉身變臉還被我看到。收盤子和倒水都要三催四請，這種輕浮的態度和因為膚色而有的歧視真令人難以忍受。  ","20"
"michelv977","It has been a great experience, but I don’t think the rating as 5th best restaurant in the city is a true reflection of what they offer. Food was good (those ribs!), as was the service, but I was not blown away... It is also a very touristy place (probably thanks to their Tripadvisor rating). We went on a Friday evening. Full house, but we didn’t hear any Danish around us...","40"
"D3875WKbarbaraw","Absolutely fabulous. Agree with the other reviews - probably one of our best dinners. We emailed last minute on a Saturday, they fit us in and we enjoyed every minute. Mushroom soup/ salmon tartare / risotto all sooo very good. Wait staff knowledge and so nice. Really cute on the inside. Highly recommend.","50"
"dunxinafrica","Guided here by Tripadviser and not disappointed. Relatively limited menu but all looked good. Two of us had pork loin (delicious) and our daughter veal ribs - a start that she had as a main and I am sure that they boosted with extra and more veg - again delicious! Staff friendly and attentive and made us very welcome. Although the place was busy they seemed to have as much time as needed to see to us, discuss menu, chat etc. Even managed a Danish flag and sparkler with my birthday dessert (nice creme brûlée). Come and eat here - you won’t be disappointed!","50"

I have got recomendation from my friend and I have to say I could not do better :) I had goat cheese as starter and pork tenderloin and great finish with cheese plate with port wine. Amazing taste and combinations. You have to try it.","50"
"viewmaster1","... in my professional life, but I'm sure i never had better veal ribs. Chose for two starters as i can't resist capre sause on anything; but for this local cod they nailed it; proper quality, cooked to perfection. Tripadvisor rocks when it comes to finding local gems!","50"
"jan_pons","The way any restaurant should be, great service: Oh you are a bit early but there is a great bar down the street or a pub on the other side. Food was fantastic with well balanced flavors. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful. A bit short wine list especially on desert wine.","50"
"ocean_breezes","I made a reservation here for my husband's 70th birthday. We were warmly greeted and taken to our reserved table that had been designated with the Danish flag. Our waiter provided us with Prosecco in honor of my husband's birthday. Because of the incredible reviews, we both ordered the Peppercorn Flank Steak. It was delicious. We shared a creme burlee that was also incredible. As good as the food was, the service was even better. We felt welcome and appreciated. I do not hesitate recommending this restaurant and will gladly return again if we are ever in Copenhagen.","50"

Attentative service with great recommendations - we opted for their taster menu which was reasonably priced and superb!   It's at the top of my best meal list right now! I was recommending it to others we spoke to whilst there - we tried to go again but hadn't made a booking, it was a pot luck off chance but wete unlucky.   So book ahead like we did on our first trip, easy to do via their website. The place is buzzing but also very intimate which is a rare find.   We will most definitely return.","50"

"Alicia1028","Dined here with my family and all of us agreed that the food was absolutely amazing and above our expectations.

"Flower53_10","We visited this trendy restaurant for a dinner and it was very good. I can’t say that it is a fine dining or very posh restaurant, but simply the whole hipster ambiance here was relaxing. The staff was very friendly and knew what they were doing.  We went for a 4 course tasting menu with the wine pairing and it was very good. My favorite so far was the creamy mushroom soup, definitely a highlight.  The wines were good and the portion quite hearty. Well worth visiting.","50"
"KM1945","Went here due to previous Tripadvisor reviews and what a find. The service was first class, the ambience excellent, plus food and wine which all six of us thought was superb. Anyone thinking of opening a restaurant should go here to see how it can be done. Only a couple of minutes walk from Norreport station so access also very good.","50"
"NadiaTrofimchuk","This is nice restaurant with a usual food and good staff. We went with the tasting menu and it was ok. It’s not like having a high kitchen experience but it was good enough. And the prices much cheaper than in most places we’ve been into. But I can tell that it was the worst chocolate fondant I have ever tried, so I do not recommend to order it.","30"

Based on the reviews we had read, we were expecting to be blown away by the food. Everything we ate was very good, but it was all a little underwhelming. My salmon was a bit overcooked and lacking in flavor. The ribs that we had for our appetizer were fantastic, however. Not sure I'd go back given how many other amazing restaurants there are in Copenhagen.","40"

"N8005WEjohnh","This place is popular and for good reason. On our first attempt to eat here they were fully booked for the whole evening so we booked for later in the week and I am glad that we did. Every thing was wonderful from the service the food and the atmosphere. We both started with the Copenhagen ribs they were devine. For our main course my wife had the Peppercorn flank steak and I chose the Panko Parmesan Chicken. Both dishes were beautifully cooked. For desert we both chose the French Vanilla Crème Brulee, a favorite of ours, and were not disappointed. Whilst the menue appeared limited with a choice of just 5 starters. 5 main courses and 5 deserts there was ample choice and following our experience this first time I would love to return to work my way through the other menu choices. This was the best restaurant we found in Copenhagen and whilst a bit on the expensive side offered value for money. I will definitely visit again on my next trip here.","50"

Well that changed everything when we ordered our appetizers two for a table of four, he had the chef split them up into four plates. The veal ribs are simply amazing I could’ve sat there all night and just eaten them. As we moved on to the main courses we were all thrilled. As the saying goes and romance this restaurant had me at hello.","50"

Whilst they questioned whether they would be able to live up to our expectations as a post wedding venue, I can honestly say that it could not have been better. They staff were fabulous.

The menu is not huge and there weren't many vegetarian options but what they had was amazing. We had the goat cheese salad, mushroom soup and risotto and all were delicious. It's not cheap but the atmosphere, service and food were all excellent. Highly recommended!","50"

The staff were extremely kind and talkative, I think it is great how they explain what is in your plate when you get served. The atmosphere was relaxed, I completely understand why it got no.4!!","50"
"Madster13","Wow. Olive Kitchen and Bar definitely lives up to its high rank on tripadvisor. Menu is quite small, but there is a variety of different dishes. They are cooked beautifully and are delicious. The mushroom soup was as good as everyone has described- it was exquisite. Definitely recommend it. Also the fish dishes were great and pudding too- fab.  The staff were great too, very friendly and helpful. Very chatty too and this was lovely. Overall definitely recommend- brilliant.","50"
"roopq","Best meal and service we had in our whole stay in Copenhagen! Incredibly accommodating staff. Polite, efficient, and kind. The mushroom soup is everything everyone has described. Best I've had anywhere. The pan seared salmon was cooked to perfection and accompanied with a light pea purée that I didn't think would compliment the flavor, but I was wrong - it's a delicate balance. The lava cake was not as good as expected, but the ice cream makes up for it. DEFINITELY Call ahead for reservations if you can. In busy times like this week of royal celebrations, soccer(football), and hockey matches, it was difficult to get seating. Bon appetite!","50"
"OVM09","Went there as it had very good reviews and my original choice was not available for that specific night.  An absolute disappointment… if you are into fine or even simply good food, its very unlikely you'll find anything to like about this place.  My main course duck was more like a starter rather than a main course. The duck itself was described by a waiter as ""crispy outside and soft inside"", but in fact it was almost opposite - greasy soft skin and absolutely dry on the inside....  Not sure how this place got to be ranked no 4....  The only highlight was the service - the waiters really try their best to deliver good service - very friendly, polite and genuine","20"
"LesBall59","Booked this way in advance as it seemed to offer good food and great reviews without breaking the bank, which many do in Copenhagen. It was a nice cosy place and busy. Staff really friendly. Nothing to do with the restaurant but a couple were sucking each other's faces off during their meal. I think it highly inappropriate in a restaurant to behave like that. I think the meal could have been excellent and nearly was..... the goats cheese starter was nice but a bit disappointing that the cheese was a coulis rather than a good slab of cheese! My fault for not reading it properly I think. A good choice in the Latin Quarter.","40"

It was the best I’ve ever had. Just down right delicious. We also had the pork tenderloin and the cod appetizer. Both were excellent.   Service was friendly and efficient. The restaurant was nicely decorated and comfortable. It has the ambiance of a neighborhood restaurant.   Bottom line; don’t miss this place if your in Copenhagen.   ","50"
"Moses H","This occasion, I had 3 other colleagues for dinner at the Olive. Two of us had salmon tartar and two had goats cheese salad. For main, two of us had norwegian salmon, one had duck confit and one steak. We unanimously enjoyed all our dishes, which were prepared to perfection.   The ambience was very lively, with everyone enjoying each other's company, their meals and the friendly service of the staff.  With one bottle of wine between us, the meal came to about forty pounds per person, which is value for money considering the quality of dishes.","50"

Our table by the windowed allowed for people watching as we thoroughly enjoyed their wine-paired tasting menu.

Service was exceptional except that it took quite a long time after request to pay our bill. This restaurant is a gem.","50"

"macounette","During a business trip I found this cozy little restaurant in downtown Copenhagen. I really enjoyed my meal. Had mushroom soup (delicious) and the steak. I asked for it ""medium rare, but more medium than rare"" and it was prepared to perfection ! Food is tasty, products are fresh and staff is adorable. Good choice of wines, too. I'll certainly come back.","50"
"JenniferC8295","We dined at Olive Kitchen and Bar on our last night in Copenhagen. While every meal in Copenhagen was fabulous, this one was superb. Our waitress was super friendly. We were traveling with our two teenage children and we all enjoyed our meal. We all had different choices of starters and entrees and every one was delicious. I am gluten intolerant and once my waitress knew, every meal was adjusted. You can’t go wrong here!","50"
"Yorkielass68","Booked this restaurant based on reviews. Extremely friendly staff, charming with a lovely ambience. Had the rhubarb diaquari cocktail which was a must if u like rhubarb.

Good value for Copenhagen pricing about 65 Euro a head for 2 cocktails, starters ,main courses & 2 glasses of wine.","40"

"Saoirse M","We found this place on our first night in Copenhagen and it was so good we went back on our last night. The menu is concise (5 - 6 options per course) but each one that we sampled was delcious. All but one dish per course was gluten free which means there was choice for me as a coeliac!!!! Dueing our two meals we sampled a number of dishes including goats cheese and beetroot salad, ribs that fell off the bone, steaks cooked to perfection, duck, beetroot risotto and chocolate fondant (not GF). Each dish was delicious and the staff explained exactly what you were eating. All staff were really friendly and helpful. I recommend booking to ensure you get a table.... Enjoy!","50"

"Buzzaway","We had a special family meal here.   We ordered three steaks from the menu, each to be cooked differently to our own palette.   Three beautifully cooked Australian flank steaks were filigreed exactly to order.   Wine list wasn’t to my taste but no matter, doesn’t detract.   Recommended.","50"

"J H","The olive kitchen and bar, was one of the best restaurants during our stay in Copenhagen. Our server Cedric was incredibly friendly, and polite. Our friend was celebrating their engagement, and started off with a few cocktails. Everyone loved the passion fruit lychee cocktail!   We started off with the salmon tartare, beef carpaccio, and veal ribs. Although we often enjoy beef carpaccio back in our hometown Vancouver, this was one definitely elevated and flavourful. For mains, we got steak and duck confit. Everything was perfect! The meat was paired nicely with the sauce and everything was cooked to perfection. We winded down the evening, with the creme brule and the chocolate lava cake. We loved the carpaccio so much we actually ended up ordering the carpaccio right after desserts! Thanks for the delicious food and Cedric for his great service!","50"
"AdamS866","We had one of the best meals out in along time on our first night in Copenhagen. I had the ribs to start which were very juicy and delicious. Then it was duck for the main. The confit of duck must have been the best I have ever tasted. The skin was just perfect. Portion sizes were also very generous meaning there was no room for dessert! Prices were also very reasonable for Copenhagen.","50"
"heathera447","Fantastic meal and service. I loved the experience at this restaurant and it is well worth the visit! I'll be dreaming of that chocolate lava cake with bourbon ice cream for quite some time.","50"
"pcorbett310","Let me start by saying I never write reviews but the Olive deserves one. This was our last meal in Copenhagen and we received not only the best service but the best meal that had my husband & I saying ""oh my god"" after our first bite of every new dish.  We got the four course menu for 350 DKK and it came with salmon tartar, mushroom soup, an entree (it comes with flank steak which my husband got but I subbed mine for the duck confit which was mindblowingly good) and we finished with the creme brulee. We also added on the ribs which were heaven. Our only complaint would be the drinks (we ordered two each) were a little too sweet but nonetheless, still delicious.  If I ever make it back to Copenhagen, this is a MUST GO for me.","50"
"StephenSW19","A wonderful restaurant. The food could not be faulted. Lovely grilled goats cheese starter followed by perfectly cooked salmon and the best crème brulee I have tasted in a long time to finish. Accompanied by an excellent Californian chardonnay. The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive and the whole atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming.","50"

"HolmanBrad","We dined at the Olive Kitchen and Bar based on the reviews we read and were not disappointed. It was our best dining experience in our three week Scandi holiday - food was great and very comforting for our family as we are not big seafood eaters that many of the Scandi restaurants focus on. The Olive was reasonably priced for both food and drinks and we enjoyed it so much on our first visit that when we came back through Copenhagen to make our way home back to Sydney - we went again. The fact that the team recognised us after three weeks and could remember what we had eaten and the wine we had chosen just shows how tremendous the team there are. Many thanks to Will the owner for making this such a pleasurable dining experience.","50"

We did enjoy our meal though and for Copenhagen thought the prices reasonable. We would have liked to have visited again and had a more leisurely meal but just no time.","50"
"Malcolm B","We had a few days in Copenhagen just before Christmas to celebrate our wedding anniversary and chose The Olive as the restaurant for our anniversary dinner. It's a small, family-run restaurant, with a limited - but still very varied - menu, which offers something for everyone. About half a dozen starters, all at the same price, a similar number of main courses (again priced the same) and 4-5 desserts. The staff who we met were all very pleasant, helpful and informative. I had a goat's cheese starter, with rocket, dribbled with honey and on a bed of beetroot discs, while my wife had salmon tartare with onions and capers on a bed of avocado mousse, with Danish rye bread. For our main course, we both chose the restaurant's signature dish - a flank steak, with a peppercorn and dill sauce, fondant potato with parmesan and mixed vegetables. All were beautifully cooked and presented and absolutely delicious. We had a glass of prosecco each to start, a nice bottle of South African Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon and water (which is charged for). It all came to just over 1,000 krone (about £120), which is quite a lot, but well worth it for a special night out.","50"

My one sticking point was a feeling of being slightly rushed through the courses. The restaurant was busy but not packed to the brim so I thought this was a bit unnecessary. It’s good value by Copenhagen standards though. And it’s a yes from me!","40"

"oneworldtravelbug","My fiancé and I dined at Souls, Olive Kitchen, Kød, the Red Box, Krebsegaarden, Kødbyens Fiskebar, Cafe Gl.Torv, Le Sommelier, and Zahida while I stayed in Copenhagen for one week. In order of preference, Olive Kitchen was best, and Red Box was our least favorite. We ordered the veal ribs and flank steak. Both were exceptional quality food, prepared perfectly. The service was very attentive, but not overbearing. The price (relative to Copenhagen) was the best value of all the above. Small menu of high quality produce and meats. This is not trying to be Noma or Geranium. But it succeeds in this competitive market.","50"

The food was yummy, I had the steak which was perfect and the service was so friendly.","50"

They missed the wine off the bill and i told them since it wasnt fair to take advantage.   the place was busy the whole time we were there and they were constantly turning people away who arrived on spec.  overall a great meal and evening.","40"

"paulwithcheryl","Visited on a Sunday evening and it was busy all evening. Pre booking is essential as I saw 2 sets of people turned away as they had not booked. We had the 4 course set menu with accompanying wines and were delighted with the experience. First course was salmon tartare with rye bread. Second was mushroom soup, but the best mushroom soup I have ever eaten! The main course was 2 beautiful pieces of beef, and vegetables that had been stir fried so retained some crispness. Crème brûlée finished off the meal and in the words of our server ""tasted as a crème brûlée should"". Great experience and great food.","50"

"djurista","This was an amazing restaurant and each dish was flavorful and stood out. Every ingredient tasted very fresh.   I had the passion fruit lychee drink to start which was tart and refreshing. Then I went with their pre-fix meal but changed the appetizer out to the beef carpaccio. It was amazing. Parmesan mayo on beef carpaccio with truffle and a fresh crunch on top of pickled onion. Next was the mushroom truffle soup. The second it came over you could smell the fragrant truffles. Although you would think this was heavy.. It was light and very tasty. For the main course it was the steak. Cooked perfectly you could taste the fresh meat accompanied by layered potatoes and fresh cooked vegetables. A delicious sauce on the side. For desert, a creme brûlée. Not the best creme brûlée I have had, but all together an extremely delicious meal! I would go back in a second.","50"
"Cheesy30","This restaurant is easy to find, close to Norreport station. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, very cosy and staff are really lovely and attentive. The menu is small, but caters for any preference, I chose the salmon tartar for starters which was really nicely done, only slight criticism, it could have had a little more creamy avocado with it, my husband had the beef carpaccio with parmesan mayo, which was really tasty and great textures, again, only slight criticism would be a little more mayo. For main I had the salmon again, which was really tasty and my husband had the pork with mash, slightly too sweet for his liking, but all nicely cooked. Dessert was brulee, which had the good crunch a brulee should have with fresh fruit on top, I had the cheese platter, the cheese choice was good. The wine was also pretty good. Overall, I would certainly recommend this restaurant, for Copenhagen prices it is certainly good value for money.  I would suggest that it would be an idea to have 2 different fish for starter and main, if you love fish like I do, it would be nice to have a variety, rather than salmon for starter and main, although it doesn't take away from the fact they were both good.","40"

"tinaq_reviews","Booked a table for two for a Sunday night evening - great as some places are closed. We had beef carpaccio, salmon tartar, a duck special and salmon filet with a chocolate cookie to share as a desert. The menu is small, consists of about five starters, five mains and five deserts. It's not very novel, the foods are what can be considered classics, but the execution is crafty and delicious. I really enjoyed the crispy skin on my duck. The cocktails are very inspired and cool, I appreciate the fact there are some quite strong and not so sweet. Good selection of wines too. Very friendly and attentive service. My only complaint would have been the lighting: more light please, I hate eating in dark and not seeing my food properly.","40"
"Chickie997","My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights in Copenhagen and visited the Olive because of other reviews. It did not disappoint! The service, atmosphere and food was absolutely brilliant.

I would definitely come back here when visiting Copenhagen again!","50"

The wait staff was friendly and excellent service. I had their fix menu with wine tasting and was very happy when there was flexibility in changing up some of the dishes. The meal was excellent and reasonable priced for Copenhagen, which is a very expensive place to eat. My wife enjoyed her meal so much, that we went there again on our third night. Our meal with apps, main and share dessert with wine tasting was just over $200.00 cdn. Excellent value and highly recommend.","50"

Has a lovely relaxed, friendly atmosphere inside and the lighting for us was just right. slightly romantic even!  We both had the Beef Carpaccio to start and it was lovely. Really tasty and well put together with little pink peppercorns, pretty generous sized portion as well :)! My husband had the pork as a main and he loved it, I personally had the risotto. Apple & Asparagus and it was sooooooo good. Really amazing flavours, not too sweet from the apple, just absolutely right. The chef here has amazing skills.  We didn't have desert as frankly were pretty full from those two dishes, they really were decent sized.   Highly recommend this place to anyone.","50"

"Ifhk","We enjoyed dinner here on the night before our cruise left from Copenhagen. We were a bit jet lagged, but so ready for a great meal. And this restaurant certainly did not disappoint.   The staff were so incredibly friendly and attentive. We could not have asked for better service. But that was just the start. The food was beyond fantastic. Having travelled the world, this restaurant was right up there with some of the best, and not a hint of pretention at all.   There were four of us and we had a pretty wide selection of the menu between us. The mushroom soup was delectable. The salmon tartare was so fresh. And that was just appetizers.   For mains we enjoyed steak, salmon and their panko parmesan chicken. Each of us were so happy and had to make sure the others tried our dish. One dish was better than the next, and I cannot honestly say what was my favourite.   I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. Outstanding food. Lovely comfortable and casual atmosphere. Outstanding service.   It's a shame that this restaurant isn't in my home city. I would be a regular!","50"
"grovekitten","Had been here last year with my partner and really enjoyed the tasting menu. Have just returned with friends and the experience was amazing! The service is impeccable and unobtrusive, with staff who are exceptionally knowledgeable about the food they are serving. The menu is small but this does not make choosing courses any easier! Three of us opted for the signature steak which was melt in the mouth delicious. The wine list is varied and not that expensive for Copenhagen. A visit to The Olive Kitchen is a first rate dining experience - you would be hard pushed to get a better meal anywhere.","50"

I initially declined the kind offer but then returned later to take it up when nowhere else appealed. How glad I did! For a solo traveller in a restaurant full of groups and couples it can be an uncomfortable experience. Not here. The staff were amazingly welcoming and attentive, stopping by and making excellent conversation which matched the exquisite food (oven baked goats cheese, pork in a honey and mustard glaze and a mouth-watering chocolate dessert). I even got a great tour itinerary suggestion off the waitress (Veronica) which I followed the next day. A fabulous place and well worth its rating. Keep up the good work Will and team!","50"

We took their 4-course menu including the wine package. All dishes where well prepared, nicely displayed and the wine was excellent to all dishes. Our waitress, was very knowledgeable talked about the food and heritage of the wine in just the right way. The ambience is relaxed with families, couples and one or two Japanese tourists.   If you want a good place to go to with family or friends, good service and do not want to be ruined, then I can recommend this place","50"

"Karen W","Planned a pre-cruise dinner for 18 people that have never met! What a great place to do this. From the initial emailing with Will and trying to coordinate strangers to the greeting we received on arrival from Antonio last night, everything was perfect. The atmosphere was great, staff were amazing AND great entertainment and the food some of the best we have all had. I had the goats cheese and my husband had the ribs as a starter..yum yum yum. Mains were pork with honey mustard and steak and fresh seasonal veges. Perfect! The steak was cooked so well the knife (not a steak knife either) melted through it! Wine was great as was the shared creme brûlée.  It was reasonably priced for Copenhagen and definitely value for money - 3 delicious courses and wine $140 AUD.....absolutely worth every cent. Thanks so much to the staff on the night for making us all very welcome and taking care of us so well......if you're in Copenhagen....go here!","50"
"Lucy M","On a rainy Copenhagen night we had the best meal at The Olive Kitchen and Bar. It was warm and inviting and the food was delicious. I had the mushroom soup and the salad and it was superb.

"LibbyCincinnati","The food is very nice, and this is upscale dining in a casual environment. We opted for the pork tenderloin and the steak specialty. They were both very good. The molten chocolate cake was especially good. This is a nice place to dine if you are looking for good food in a cozy environment.They have a limited staff so you may need to wait for service, but they are all very upbeat and pleasant.   There is a single bathroom about halfway back in the restaurant on the left-hand side. It seemed to be confusing to people as they would venture in and discover someone was locked in the inner commode so they would pop back out to wait. They should install a lock on the outer door to prevent confusion.","40"
"ashima737","We spent our last evening in Copenhagen here. The restaurant was cosy and had a welcoming vibe. The drinks were great. The food was delicious. We were celebrating my hubby's birthday and when the restaurant got to know they served us port wine on the house. That was a sweet gesture! And of course the chocolate biscuit was yummy!! So Glad we choose this place. Make sure you book in advance as it's usually packed.","50"

"AndyTwoTimes","Are you a foodie, looking for a deliciuos meal in Copenhagen? Then head over to the Olive! The restaurant has a fixed four course menu with a wine package as optional add-on for as little as 535 DKK p.p. The service was great, with Danish and international staff. If you are from Norway or Sweden you'll might get a fellow Scandinavian waiting your table which of course is much more cozy. And international guests won't have any problem communicating either. The food was delicious, starting with a salmon tartar, the seconde course was a faboluous mushroom soup sprincled with micro-pices of truffles. The main course was a veal fillet with mixed vegtables cooked to the point of perfect crispiness. The meal was concluded with one of the best crème brûlées I've ever had. We were quite full at this point.  The wine package was neat with a different glass accompanying each course. Although the wines themselves were good as such, they lacked that perfect matching with the food as a premium restaurant would work hard to accomplish. But, hey, this is a 500 DKK dinner, not a 3000 DKK one so this would be reasonable. I would give a 5 star rating if they hadn't charged for the tap water. Things like that puts an outline of tackiness around the whole experience. That's something you would find ata tourist place around the Mediterranean, not a medium upscale restaurant in downtown Copenhagen.","40"

It was full on our first night so we booked it for our second night. It was a lovely cosy restaurant and all the staff were so welcoming. The menu was small but everything looked appetising. We ordered steak with a peppercorn sauce and pork fillet with a mustard sauce and both dishes came with lovely potatoes and vegetables and they were delicious. We shared a creme brûlée for dessert. We enjoyed it so much that we rebooked for the following evening and ordered the same mains but had each others. Then for pudding we shared a chocolate melt in the middle sponge with vanilla ice cream. The food was excellent, the wine was good, the service was top-notch and it wasn't overly expensive. Highly recommend.","50"

Will and his fiancé were very friendly and helpful (even accommodating our change of plans when we wanted to visit a day early - we then stuck to our original reservation - to be honest we were a pain). They could not do more to help. Everyone welcome. This would be a highly rated restaurant in any city in the world. Highly recommend.","50"
"sertxo85","Great restaurant in the centre of Copenhaguen. The place seems very normal but when you open the door you realise that you'll have an unforgettable experience. The service very kind and attentive, the food is spectacular (salmon tartar, bbq ribs and grilled beef). But the best part of the experience is when you ask for the bill, very affordable restaurant!!","50"
"Destination606713","The hosts accommodated us for this busy Friday evening as we had no reservation. We expected good food but were surprised with exceptionally tasty dishes with an attention to detail in preparation and presentation. The salmon carpaccio was delicate and very fresh tasting accompanied by delicate bread points and avocado purée. The baked Brie was balanced with a light salad and thin very crispy ham slice- delightful combination. My daughter and I asked to share the steak With they brought plated and split. The steak was tender and perfectly medium rare with a delicate peppercorn sauce for dipping. The vegetAbles were young and sautéed all dente. The potato au gratin light and flavorful. We did not have desert But would highly recommend this gem!","50"
"AuntieMRA","The staff is very friendly here. Basically chipper and attentive. We ordered the steak and chicken. We liked the chicken more but both were very good with delicious flavors. We shared a starter of salmon tartare. I think that was the best thing we ate in Cooenhageb.","40"
"marionharter","Had a lovely dinner with appetizers, main courses and dessert that were all delicious. The waiters were extremely nice and attentive and explained each dish.

"davidbO2787GE","First of all reservation. Did for same day on their website. Simple and worked perfectly.  Then the environment. Charm does not necessarily means spending a lot of money. Simple walls, tables,... but full of charm. Special attention given to lights, creating a cosy atmosphere.  Service: 3 young people covering the full restaurant ( and was full). Very nice , efficient and precise. Kudos for them.  The food finally: absolutely delicious. We considered Ordering the menu set, but thought would be too much. Ordered them the mushroom soup, and was the best of its type ever had. As waiter said, simple and delicious. Then the signature steak. No words to describe. Again simple and sophisticated. A delicious spicy sauce and grilled to perfection veggies.  And to finish , not so expensive for danish prices.","50"
"BibiLaerke","Simply just awesome. Lovely, friendly & bubbly staff, relaxed atmosphere + delicious and tasty food. No complaints at all. Highly recommend the place! Was my roomies birthday, and the staff did more than enough for us to celebrate her. Thx guys!","50"
"laras455","Amazing food! We had the salmon tartar which had some great flavors with red onion and avocado and capers. The ribs were super flavorful and buttery, a little too much fat for my husband but I loved them. Big portion for just a starter. We shared the honey glazed pork. They kindly split the meal for us on two plates. Deliciously sweet caramelized onions with a subtle Dijon mustard topping. We had the cheese plate for desert. Favorite cheese was the mascarpone blue cheese so creamy and not overpowering. With 2 starters, sharing an main course, and a cheese plate for desert we were full they have good portions and reasonable prices for quality food and ambience in expensive Copenhagen. They charge 10 kr per person for unlimited water (no tap) but that's ok. Super friendly service, noticeably faster than most restaurants here we have been to, and a nice trendy with out being pretentious ambiance.","50"
"Bob S","We ate here three weeks ago while visiting Copenhagen, loved it and made a reservation for our return later.  Recommended dishes- barbecue ribs as appetizer, chicken panko entree, risotto entree and chocolate dessert. Will(owner), Cedric and Kristal were all great in offering service and advice. Fabulous cocktails as well- try the Lychee, passion fruit vodka cocktail. Good quality wines at reasonable prices. This restaurant is a total winner. Dinner only.","50"

It ticked all of the boxes in terms of food, wine list, ambience, and value. Sure we had some players that were better. Some locations with nicer views. But on terms of the overall experience, this was it.  Highlights were the ribs, the beef and the chocolate dessert!'","50"

Everything in evening was perfect inlcuding the lovely walk back to the hotel through the lovely old town.. Only one small niggle was the draft from the door- it was a cold evening and nothing to prevent the draft hitting you when the door was opened - perhaps a curtain or a second door into the restaurant could deal with this - small comment in an otherwise perfect evening","50"

"koen75koen","What a great restaurant! Their website says that they are focused on casual, homecooked food. This is exactly what they do although you don't find many homes where they cook as good as in this place. After trying some innovative Danish cuisine the day before, our children were very happy ending up in The Olive Kitchen & Bar where they recognized the things they had on their plate. The risotto was delicious, so were the steak and the salmons and the crème brûlée and chocolat desserts. Service was excellent as well.","50"
"travelallthetime55","The service at the Olive Kitchen was brilliant, friendly, helpful and honestly interested in your dining experience. This was backed up by the most delicious food I have had in a long time. I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic dinner or a dinner with a group of friends. The prices are reasonable for Copenhagen. The menu is quite small, but has plenty to suit any palette. My top choice in Copenhagen.","50"

"Vesa J","We travel to Copenhagen annually and always do research and pick the restaurants carefully. Copenhagen is the food capital of the Nordics so there is a lot of great places to choose from. Luckily this year we booked a table at The Olive. Our waiter Antonio was extra friendly and did a great job helping us with the choises. We had the signature menu with a bottle of nice Barbera d'Asti red wine. All of the dishes were astonishing and the size of the portions was decent. Great value. Me and my wife highly recommend this place!","50"
"RoshiniDhaliwal","Beautiful food and wine. I had the goats cheese to start, salmon for main and chocolate cake. Staff were very knowledgeable and able to recommend wine per course. Cute restaurant, not fancy or with a particular buzz but there is a nice ambience. Good value for money","50"
"Veronicacalling","Enjoyable meal but not spectacular. Very (overly?) attentive staff very keen to engage in conversation. Had ribs as starter; not great, a bit too dry. Main course chicken was tasty enough.","50"
"Blisnot","I read some comments on here and decided to try. Managed to get a same day reservation for 5.15 By 6.30 it was packed. Understandably so as everything about it is excellent including the smiling welcome from one of the owners, and Antonio who took orders and the waitresses were very happy and friendly. The food itself was delicious and reasonably priced. Highly recommended.  ","50"

There is such a good variety to choose from. It was also the service that made this a memorable dinner as the many other reviews have pointed out. Rebecca thank you for your excellent service! The last point is that we found the prices to be very reasonable and the portion sizes generous. Overall the olive definitely lived up to the reputation we've been reading about - highly recommended!","50"
"Passenger633872","We received a warm greeting and were quickly seated even though we were over and hour early for our table. ( you can't take children into bars in Copenhagen it seems) The restaurant was full and had a lovely, cosy ambiance but with trendy olive coloured walls and wood flooring. The menu is quite limited with just 5 dishes to choose from but they all sounded so tasty that we struggled to narrow down our choice. The wild mushroom soup was the best I have ever tasted and the carpaccio was delicious too. For mains I would recommend the steak or chicken which were outstanding. Service throughout was warm, attentive, friendly and authentic: a rare combination. All deserts were great too but if I had a small critique it would be that the cheese board would have been better just with 'normal cheese' rather than blue cheese mixed with marscapone, and the port would have been better served at room temperature. Overall a very very good meal with standout service. Oh, worth mentioning that it's not cheap, over £210 for 2 adults and 2 children.","50"

"nickyw_12","We came here purely based on Trip Advisor recommendations to celebrate a Birthday.   The food quality is outstanding but it's the special attentive service that makes it such a memorable experience. We have been lucky enough to visit several Michelin starred restaurants in our life, but we can honestly say that we have never had service as good as we received here. The staff genuinely enjoy their job and are passionate about the cuisine, and this shines through.   We had the tasting menu with paired wine which was really reasonable (especially by Danish standards). We were really well looked after, without it being intrusive and we never felt rushed despite it being a busy Saturday night.   I would recommend this to groups, couples or simply anyone who wants to enjoy a lovely evening of delicious food and fantastic service!   Thank you for making our trip to Copenhagen so memorable.

"Snublemannen","Went here for a dinner and had the 4 course meal.  The staff was very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the food, and cocktails. I wish they had better beer on offer, but the cocktails were very nice. The food was good quality and very affordable. It is not the most ""out there"" style of cooking, but all together nice. We left very happy with the drinks, food and service. Would recommend!","50"

"Starryhaze87","We went to the restaurant at the end of January as part of our 4 day visit and this by far outshone anything else we did.   I have nothing but nice things to say. First of all, the staff were so friendly and attentive even though they were only two of them servicing a very busy restaurant.   Not only did they spend time getting to know us but every meal or drink choice was explained from where it was from, how it was made to why they love it.   The food itself was exquisite. I had the ribs to start, pork with goats cheese for main and mocha pud for dessert. It is some of the best food I have ever eaten, divine! My partner had the cheese course which included a blue cheese mixed with mascapone which was to die for!   To top it off, the meal was incredibly well priced, not expensive at all. Such good value for money and such an understated special restaurant, could not recommend this more. Go and visit right away!","50"
"Edouard L","My girlfriend and I had a great dinner in this very cosy and welcoming restaurant.

"Neelam_S18","Eating here while in Copenhagen is a must. The food is delicious. I had the steak (which was cooked perfectly), and my friend had the duck, which she said was amazing.   But the service is what really makes this place stand out. They are all so attentive, I cannot fault them at all.  I would have expected this place to be more expensive than it actually is. For info my friend and I had a main meal each, shared the creme brûlée (very very tasty), 2 soft drinks and 2 waters for a total of 515dk (around £60) which I thought was very good value for a place like this.   Definitely recommend. Check this place out while you're in Copenhagen, you won't regret it!","50"

"Anthony M","They easily accommodated our toddler, and were incredibly friendly. We asked for special menu consideration and they handled it perfectly. Meat was cooked to perfection, veggies were delicious, and sauces were impeccable. They explained everything brought to the table like we were at a michelin restaurant.

"Laura-Jade T","My partner and I visited here based on it's Tripadvisor reviews.  We opted for the set menu for a taste of Scandinavian cuisine. The food was delicious and in terms of Copenhagen - well priced. Each course and the wine was lovely. The restaurant was cosy, intimate and inviting. Staff were really friendly and helpful and explained each course.  Scandinavia is expensive - and we paid the same price as you would pay for a higher end restaurant at home - about £120 for two with a bottle of wine. However when you take it in to consideration that everything in Denmark is more expensive than in the UK and compare it to other restaurants - I would say The Olive Kitchen & Bar is priced well.  Definitely the best meal we had in Copenhagen without the Michelin star price tag!","50"
"Anjelina S","I picked this restaurant to celebrate my 26th birthday. The Olive absolutely made my day special! The staff was amazing, the food was delicious!

Real strength is personnel, super cordial and always caring about you, big up for it. If I can make a suggestion, think about changing the way to serve vegetables, too crunch and tasteless with regards to the main course, they can be valued more! Follow some receipts according to southern eu standards","50"

Only a small place but outstanding service and food. The mushroom soup was the best we had ever had and was the star starter, the mushrooms and the carpaccio an easy joint second. The mains of steak, duck and pork were superb we really couldn't fault it. Good selection of wine as well. Incredibly friendly knowledgeable staff made this a memorable evening - highly recommend","50"

"Svein-Magne_Tunli","This small family operated restaurant is focusing on casual, home cooked food. My wife and I ordered the Olive´s 4 course menu with wine pairing. Everything on the menu tasted delicious! (Norwegian Salmon Tartar, Stuffed Mushroom Caps, Olive´s Signature Steak and French Vanilla Creme Brulee). The food was also presented in a very professional way (see my attached photos).  What really makes this dinner memorable was the unique service from the outstanding staff. The young staff were great and very friendly with a cosy and comfy atmosphere.  The young lady serving us the wines was just outstanding! We have never experienced so much interesting information about the wine – and she did it with a big smile!  This is definitely one of the best restaurants we have visited during our many trips to beautiful Copenhagen.   We will be back!  Regards Svein-Magne Tunli from Bergen, Norway.","50"
"bethie331","We absolutely loved The Olive. We had made a reservation in advance, which I suggest as we saw quite a few people turned away (and it was a Sunday!). We actually showed up about an hour earlier as I forgot when we had our reservation and they were kind enough to let us sit near the bar for about 20 mins until they sat us. The staff was very sweet and we really enjoyed talked to them. We started with the ribs and then I had the pork dish and my husband had the steak. Everything was delicious! We really liked the wine as well. We know Copenhagen has a lot of restaurants to choose from, but we thought this was the perfect place. It was reasonably priced (at least we thought so from Chicago), cozy, and delicious. I only wished we had a couple more days so we could have gone back!!","50"
"matteesse","No offence, but it may sound strange to put ""Denmark"" and ""excellent food"" in the same phrase, especially if you come from Italy. I must say that ""The Olive"" has been a great surprise and I am very glad to admit that I was wrong: the place is very nice and cosy, and we were delighted by the food.

"henryf356","Booked a day in advance based on reviews previously. I chose the set menu with wine which I felt represented best value. Split into 2 areas it provides a relaxed atmosphere & a certain coziness that that is appealing. The staff (Rebecca) were very friendly & explained each course with the accompanying wines. Throughly enjoyed the experience & would recommend as a must visit.","40"

"Roger M","Of the three restaurants that we ate in for our evening meal, this was our favourite. Our reception by the maitre d' was immediate and extremely pleasant and warm; a warmth that was evident with the waitresses also. They were genuinely keen to ensure that all was well.  The food was gorgeous, kind of gastropub. Beef carpaccio to start with was perfect. Duck main course very well cooked and presented beautifully.  The Olive is clearly very popular, and deservedly so. It is a slick operation that is very honest and professional. I would certainly return if back in Copenhagen.","50"
"Kristina H","So good! We dined here to celebrate a special event and decided to go with the 4 course meal with wine pairings and did not regret it! The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was really good! Every course was scrumptious, I really liked the steak and the salmon tartar was delicious as well. We definitely recommend this place","50"
"gerarfg","First evening in CPH and looking for good food near Indre by (pedestrian area) and found out about the olive ...... nice cozy place with nice staff and simple but tasty food.

"Dealzz","I am gluten and dairy free as well as not being able to eat certain other foods so a bit of a nightmare to take out. We phoned ahead to see if they could cater for my needs and they were most helpful and reassuring so we went ahead and booked. On entering the restaurant we were immediately impressed with the natural ambience and the staff were really warm and welcoming. Straight away they made suggestions to my menu choice and were extremely helpful. For the first time in a very long time I felt I wasn't a problem and I had the best meal out I have probably eaten since my medical eating issues were discovered. I was even able to have a dessert...a complete rarity for me in a restaurant these days. We were also impressed that our sparkling water was constantly topped up for no extra charge. We would highly recommend this restaurant especially if you have food allergies like myself and even if you don't, like my husband, who was equally impressed with his menu choice and food. Fabulous staff too who are a credit to this business.","50"

"Primus30","The service was good, but I was a little disappointed with the food. I had the Duck and side dishes on the plate was cold and not perfectly cooked. It was as the vegetables were not cooked at all. My husband had the beef dish and the meat was perfectly cooked.","40"
"Aoife R","We choose to eat at this restaurant based on reading a lot of reviews and I am delighted we were not disappointed. This was without doubt our stand out meal on our four night break. My husband had the stuffed mushrooms & duck and I had the salmon tartar & steak. Both meals were amazing. The waiting staff were very attentive but also intuitive as they sensed very quickly we like to get on with it ourselves & don't like to be fussed over! The meal was very reasonable & this restaurant is a must if visiting Copenhagen.","50"
"Alexandre_Y10","The wait staff at the restaurant were extremely helpful, courteous, jovial, and kind! They were happy to introduce their food and spoke about it passionately! They were ever willing to explain each dish and willing to engage in conversation with us about where we were from and how we were doing today!  The food itself was tasty, and worth every penny. We went for the 4 Course menu and it did not disappoint. The Salmon Tartar was fresh and ignited our taste buds for more! The Stuffed Mushroom Caps were juicy and flavoursome. The Signature Steak was tender, equally juicy, and came with the most delicious pepper sauce. The Crème Brûlée was creamy and offered just the right sweet touch to end off the meal.   Though we were lucky to get seats having not made any reservation, we were entirely pleased with the service and food. We will not hesitate to come back again!","50"
"Tony V","This was our first time here, and we had a lovely dinner and the food lived up to expectations. The staff was very nice and gave us top service.

I would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely come back!","50"
"jmcwilliams2016","I feel so lucky to have found this gem while visiting Copenhagen for the weekend with my girlfriend. The food was simply incredible and the service was second to none. Everyone was so lovely and really made the whole experience feel special. Price was very reasonable for the quality of food and in an expensive city. Would make this my first port of call if I visited the city again.","50"
"Danny W","We thoroughly enjoyed a fantastic meal at the olive kitchen. The food was some of the best I've eaten and would be on the level of some Michelin star restaurants. Very well priced too. A limited menu but that was perfect. The service was impeccable, everyone was so welcoming, relaxed and knowledgable. Every course came with a run through of what was on the plate, always with a little story behind it. We were there 2.5hrs... no pressure to eat and go. I would highly recommend the ribs, steak (with a glass of Malbec) and cheese with a glass of tawny port (the Stilton with mascarpone... omg). Will return one day for sure.","50"
"bibibibibupo","We spent a great evening with a delicious meal here. The quality of the dishes was outstanding... tasty and also very nice to look at them.

"DesmondCapone","I had researched gluten free restaurants in Copenhagen before I came and this restaurant came up and got really good reviews, so we decided to try it. Food and service were amazing. I let them know beforehand that I was gluten intolerant. The menu is labeled for gluten free and Vegan. The owner, Will, came out to talk to me specifically about my food allergies. That was a really nice touch. I also mentioned that we were in Copenhagen for my 50th birthday, and Will brought out two glasses of champagne. We started with the salmon tartar and it was served with gluten free bread. It melted it our mouths. We had the flank steak for our main course and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Portions were perfect too. Not too little, not too much. We walked out pleasantly full. I would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely come back!","50"
"aisb2015","Dined here on Friday night. Great choice on menu. Was delighted to see gluten free options noted on menu. Waitress also very helpful with confirming my choices were gluten free. Staff were so welcoming & upbeat. Loved their stories on each course as it arrived. Steak was fabulous as were the ribs to start. Wine choice also very good. I would have no hesitation recommending this place for a great night out.","50"

We did not regret our decision, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and the restaurant was cosy and warm. The food was excellent and the waiting staff took the time to speak to you and explain what the food was - without going over the top like they do in some restaurants.   If we were to find ourselves in Copenhagen in the future then we would definitely return here.  ","50"
"GMoore_11","Had a superb experience at this place. The menu is limited, which is great because the focus is on presenting perfect food. We went for the 4 course menu. The plates were not too large but we left the restaurant feeling satisfied. The steak was one of the best I've ever had, cooked beautifully. The staff were very attentive and explained each of the courses in great detail when it was presented. Highly recommended!  Just one thing. Some reviewers complain about the length of time to serve the food. We found the service to be relaxed but not at all slow, meaning we could really enjoy the atmosphere, we didn't feel rushed and were able to make an evening of the meal.","50"

We closed with a shared cheese dish - not huge but an intriguing selection   It's just shy of fine dining and the staff keep it feeling very relaxed.  Careful where you sit if your eyes are fading - we were sat in the gloom! But overall this place is top notch   ","50"

"lindarX5316AS","We rarely run a repeat dinner outing while traveling but the first night dazzled us! The menu is not extensive so it was a bit of trade offs that didn't disappoint. Between four of us over two nights we tried the beef carpaccio, salmon tartare and the stuffed mushrooms. We appreciated that the kitchen split them into two portions so we could share and enjoyed all of them. The salmon was excellent with the glazed fennel accompaniment and my husband's pork tenderloin was very tender perfectly cooked with a side of mashed potatoes laced with apples. The second night we both tried the steak cooked to medium rare at our request and we thoroughly enjoyed it with the pan roasted vegetables and potato and Parmesan gratin side. The wines are fairly priced and the food prices are what you would expect from a nice restaurant in the city. But the one thing that I would add is the service was some of the best we have seen in a while. The enthusiasm of all the staff made a great dinner even better and we loved hearing the brief description of each item. In a city full of choices, The Olive should be one to try.","50"
"Matt_Que","My fiancé and I are visiting Copenhagen from Boston, Massachusetts, USA. I preface with this, as we live in the city and dine out often. The Olive Kitchen & Bar is truly the total package, and I dare say, may set your bar very high for your next dining experience.   Every course was incredible, however for those who dine as much as we do, understand that this is only half of the experience. The entire staff at The Olive went above and beyond to make your dinner enjoyable, both by accommodation and engagement. They made it abundantly clear that they loved being there and wanted their patrons to as well.  We enjoyed the service and meal(s) so much, that this was our second visit this week.","50"

"Jamie K","The Olive stood up to its glowing reviews on here, and we thoroughly enjoyed our lovely meal on a Saturday evening. We opted for the set menu and enjoyed salmon tartare, crab stuffed mushrooms (sooo good!), and they were kind enough to allow my husband the steak and me to choose the salmon since I don't eat beef. The Norwegian salmon was delicious, and again they were very accommodating as I have a dietary restriction also against eating undercooked seafood. We finished with a creme brulee. Good wine, very nice staff. Highly recommend!","50"

The mushroom soup was stunning and the steak was massive and cooked to perfection. Waitress service was spot on - very friendly and particularly helpful when asked for directions to our next stop of the night. Well worth a visit for a special occasion without breaking the bank too much!","50"
"Sarah L E","We visited The Olive on the last night of a short trip to Copenhagen and we really enjoyed it. The food was very tasty - we had crab stuffed mushrooms, steak and salmon plus two desserts. It was expensive but worth it. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we were sorry that we couldn't leave more of a tip (we ran out of money as it was our last night!). We will leave extra next time we visit! We would both recommend this place :)","50"
"Njls","This is a lovely place to have dinner... But I wouldn't rate it as spectacular.... And to pay over 1000DK I could suggest other restaurants that are more "" wow""  Service: impeccable, amazing, attentive   Restaurant: Nothing special inside- would have expected skandi decor but it looks like any other restaurant, therefore the atmosphere is lacking. When you go to other restaurants to compare you will get what I mean.  Food: Had the set menu (350DK), steak & salmon were superb but the stuffed parmesan mushrooms felt a bit bland for such a high end restaurant.   Wine was good and not too expensive. 2 set menus, bottle of wine, 2 drinks, was 1000DK  Overall it was a lovely meal, tasty, plentiful... but not the spectacular experience we had expected ( or got from other places). I think the reviews and the ""vibe"" of the place sets itself up for something it falls just short of delivering.","30"

"tyrou0","I showed up without a booking, and they were nice enough to find me a table, provided I wouldn't stay too long. I appreciated their flexibility, that was the start of a great visit.  The food was excellent, I had raw salmon, then a cooked salmon fillet, both were delightful.  The service is what you would expect in a much more expensive restaurant. The waitress was never far, but never became annoying, and she provided great information about the dishes.  Definitely a place I would recommend, both for their food, and the awesome service that goes along with it.","50"

"Cruisin_Bunnies","Based on the reviews of Trip Advisor, we booked a table at The Olive before we left home. We had never done this before, but we were meeting up with friends who were going to be in Copenhagen at the same time we would be there. Unfortunately we booked the table for Sunday night, and they were only going to be in town on Saturday. Fortunately, we were able to book a table for Saturday, and we didn’t cancel our reservation on Sunday. Unfortunately, our friends’ flight was delayed, and we didn’t meet them (unfortunate for them since they did not experience the pleasure of dining at this wonderful restaurant). Fortunately for us, we did eat there two nights in a row.  The first thing that needs to be said is that we saw people who just walked in being turned away. While the restaurant is not so small, it seems to be a good idea to make a reservation if you can.  The food was scrumptious. All of the food tasted “clean,” no artificial flavors. We had the duck, served with mashed potatoes, red cabbage, and cranberries; the Norwegian salmon, served with quinoa and grilled veggies, and the flank steak, with scalloped potatoes and grilled veggies. We recommend them all, if you like duck, this one is outrageous. And the self-saucing chocolate cake with ice cream borders on the decadent.  While the food is delicious and reasonably priced, this restaurant stands out because of its ambience, reflected in the attentive service and congenial attitude of the staff. Eating at the Olive was a delightful experience. We had a hard time resisting going back every night that we were in Copenhagen.  ","50"
"FfosFelin","A very enjoyable experience with some very well cooked food. People bring turned away so imperative to book. Has an international as opposed Danish feel. Glad I tried it but wouldn't likely go again. Nice idea to have continuous chilled water for a 1 kroner.","40"
"Adel A","this one is fresh out of the oven ! first thing is first , do reserve a table ! reception is warm and the atmosphere is great , waitresses are welcoming ! especially Rebeca. the menu is small but efficient . for the appetizer i tried stuffed mushroom and the fantastic ribs ! the steak was also quiet satisfying but not the i have had .","40"
"Christine M","What a wonderful restaurant. The atmosphere was a great mix of stylish, informal and private. The staff were very attentive and the food was exceptionally good. We were not rushed in any way and I felt that the cost was reasonable for the great food that we had. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. We all walked away having had an excellent meal and overall dining experience.","50"
"KLMiner521","We visited The Olive Kitchen on a couples trip to Copenhagen this summer, and absolutely loved it. Every course we had was better than the last. The starter ribs fell off the bone and were so so delicious, and all 4 of the main courses we tried were perfect.   The service was also exemplary - very attentive to our comfort and needs and incredibly welcoming.   It was our first night in the city and served as a perfect introduction, setting a very high bar. We will be back.","50"
"AlexanderF85","I had the chance to dine here on my second try as the first time they had all the tables reserved. This is quite a small restaurant and they do get full quite fast so do make a reservation. I had the panfried salmon, exquisite taste. Price is decent for Copenhagen too and staff was extremely friendly. Especially Antonio!","50"
"Technicaltom24","You have to go here if you're in Copenhagen. Such delicious food and the most awesome staff who are so friendly. This isn't a restaurant for those on a budget but if you want a special night out you must go. I'd also recommend booking as it gets busy and it's not a big place.","50"
"Wang C","We spent about 450 kr. For dinner , no alcohol, I ordered a salmon tartar to share and I got the special steak which is a flank steak and my wife got the beetroot Risotto. Both are nicely done and tasty. The service is impeccable. My wife knocked her glass over and the waitress was quick to clear the mess, remained claim and replaced the napkins like nothing has happened. She even asked if my iphone was ok and not soaked. Well what can I say? Five stars for that!","50"
"mhny2525","Do not miss this place. The location is close to the Norreport metro station and has only been in business for 7 months. I would go before it gets too well known, although you already need to reserve if you want to be sure to get in. The menu is relative small but diverse enough to cover most tastes. The food is absolutely amazing as is the service. We have already reserved to go back before we leave town next week.","50"
"Benjamin4000","The Olive Kitchen & Bar = Awesome food at a great price  I had the best dinner in Copenhagen at the price level of 'The Olive Kitchen & Bar' a few days ago. I have not come across any restaurant in Copenhagen at the level of this one where you can get a starter for 85 DKK and a main course for 175  The food is simple and modern. I had the pleasure of good mushroom soup as a started and neatly cooked salmon for the main course. All the courses my company and I got had original twist though nothing too fancy  Do order a table in advance as they can be hard to come by on short notice","50"
"mattiar929","Me and my girlfriend had a perfect dinner thanks to its pink Risotto. Simply unforgettable. Furthermore, the guys of the restaurant are really kind and are explaining you the meaning of their dishes.","50"
"ScottyandRyan","Myself and my partner looked online for a restaurant that had good reviews online and reasonably priced and we found the olive kitchen and bar, the decor is lovely and relaxed and so is the atmosphere. The staff really make this place, very friendly and I would go as far to say quite charming and it's not fake it is genuine warmth and charm, then we come to the food. The menu is small and that screams quality and freshness, the food arrived and it was described in detail by the staff and the taste was divine. The price is amazing for the quality and I will not hesitate to come back to this little hidden away restaurant. Do yourself a favour travel slightly outside of the very centre of Copenhagen and try this little place.","50"
"Sean F","We stumble upon this restaurant by accident and was lucky enough to get a table, I'd recommend booking.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  We spent a week in cph and this was the nicest (but most expensive ) we ate at. We wanted somewhere that bit nicer and we were not disappointed.  We had the most delicious steak, although a little small compared to home, but it was so succulent.  I almost didn't give 5 stars because of a waiter/manager walking around chatting to the customers about where they were from and where the food was sourced and how it was cooked etc. I'm sure some people would love this but it isn't my sort of thing.  I'd highly recommend this establishment.","50"
"lisa m","I will write another review soon of this restaurant as i plan to return in a couple weeks. but suffice it to say that for any of you who are suffering from the crappy service and boring menus in Italy (the best and most creative albeit authentic Italian food i have ever eaten was in Pavones, Costa Rica and San Francisco/Los Angeles. And the service was far, far superior from the Italian staff in these restaurants) please enjoy the creative food and delightful service you will find at this restaurant. You won't be turned away 10 minutes before the official closing of the kitchen because some kind of apathetic attitude takes over the host/hostess or grumpy chef. that will not happen (until you return to italy). Enjoy the atmosphere and friendly waitstaff and flavorfull, delightful meal. can't wait to return","50"
"MarieC3704","Very nice place. Staff very friendly and the food very tasty. Good idea to book as it is a very popular place. Would certainly return.","40"
"KorinneJA","We were warmly welcomed on arrival which really set the tone for the amazing night ahead. The menu is not huge but the dishes offered are wonderfully delicious, made with fresh regional ingredients and presented beautifully. The cocktails - wow! Reasonably priced, also made with fresh juices and the perfect amount of alcohol. Although the food and drinks here were great, the thing that made this dining experience so memorable was the service. Every single waiter/ess that came to our table was friendly, professional, knowledgable, attentive while at the same time not getting in the way or being too present. I really cannot fault the service. A++  The only very slight negative (and this is me being picky) was that the bathroom could have done with a little freshen up during our time there as it was a busy night and there were a lot of guests in and out.","50"
"Melsy1","We ate here twice during our 4 night stay in Copenhagen.  Good menu choice, reasonable prices and excellent friendly service brought us back.  The pork ribs are generous and lightly seasoned no sauce so you can taste the meat. The gloves to eat it with are a nice touch as who wants to eat ribs with a knife and fork. My husband had the duck which was delicious and I had the pork tenderloin with goats cheese and spinach. Not keen on Apple there was no issue in changing the apple mash to mushroom mash. Nicely cooked veg.  Dessert of chocolate melt in the middle cake was lovely bitter and sweet..I wanted to lick my plate clean. :-) The food is very good, portion size just right and the ambience of the restaurant is very nice.  The Staff are super they know the menu well and were extremely friendly and look after you very well. Plenty of water provided too.  The rhubarb cocktail is very nice. We didn't have wine but found there were some reasonably priced bottles on the menu. A lovely meal to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. Advisable to book as it is popular!  ","40"
"726michaelv","The Olive Kitchen and Bar is a recommendable place in the center of Copenhagen. We went there for dinner in July 2016 and had a really good experience. Food is very good, prices really affordable and service excellent. Will definitely visit again.","50"
"antsa2015","It was definetely worth all the excellent reviews it got, the food was really good and service likewise. The only negative side was that there was only total of one toilet for both men and women. And that you need to pay for the tap water but maybe thats a custom in Denmark.","40"
"ambcde","We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and wanted somewhere special to eat that was open on a Sunday. We chose this restaurant based on TA reviews and were not disappointed. We booked online and communication from the restaurant was prompt. It was a good twenty minute walk from our hotel but definitely worth going to. The restaurant has a lovely relaxed feel to it, some diners were dressed very casually and others were very smart but everyone seemed at ease. The staff were all very friendly and the service was excellent. We opted for the al a carte menu, both having starters and main courses. The food was beautifully presented and perfectly cooked. We really couldn't have asked for a better anniversary dinner. Given that we had a bottle of Prosecco and a bottle of red wine we were really surprised at our bill which was about £115 including the service, absolutely superb value for money especially in the centre of the city. We loved it so much that it will be top of our list on any return visits to Copenhagen.","50"
"Carlalci","The staff is helpful and friendly, the food is delicious, the restaurant is well designed & relax ambience.","50"
"158stephend","There's a relatively short menu here a half dozen or so starters, mains and deserts but they do them excellently from what I saw and tasted.  The signature steak was superb (Australian beef the waitress said) and the cheese to finish also delicious. The waitress was super friendly and attentive so was everyone else that I spoke with. It's never going to be inexpensive in Copenhagen, with a sparkling water, 2 glasses of Malbec a steak, cheese and a coffee at £50 but it's better to drop £50 on good food than some of the options in CPN. This is a very good restaurant with a great atmosphere and service to match. It's worth being on a shortlist if you are after relaxed unpretentious dining with good food. I didn't hear a word of Danish spoken in the restaurant all the tables around me were using English all be it as a foreign/common language (that's a factual comment not a judgement)","50"
"jzm1im","This is a small, friendly restaurant with excellent service and great food.   The staff found the right balance between privacy and attention to make me feel welcome and relaxed.  The menu is quite small but varied. I had ribs to start, followed by beef and lastly a creme brulee. Everything was tasty and the beef was cooked perfectly to my request. The waitress gave some good advice regarding wine - again a small but varied selection - and was attentive and cheerful throughout.  Copenhagen offers much competition when it comes to eating out, but this is an excellent place to enjoy well prepared food in a friendly setting for a very reasonable price.","50"
"roxanab908","Had a very good dinner in this nice place in the center of Copenhagen. Although I didn't have a booking and the place was quite busy, they found a table for me abd ensured I got a fast service. The food was tasty - I had the mushroom soup and the duck; hearing people around me, I can tell they felt happy with the salmon and pork too. A very nice experience overall!","50"

"Casualson","We picked The Olive as it already had great reviews and was just 10 mins walk from our hotel. We booked last minute about 2 hrs in advance on a Sunday night, turned up an hour early on the off chance and they fitted us in. Great service, atmosphere and food. Highly recommended!","50"
"Danbq13","We had a great evening at the Olive. The drinks were refreshing with the tasty Dry Ribs to warm-up the appetite. The pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly, moist and flavourful. The seared salmon was very good, pared with a delicious white that complemented buttery smooth fish wonderfully. Rebecca and the other staff were friendly, attentive and informative. Highly recommend a visit to this friendly and cozy eatery.","50"
"Lara2015","The restaurant has an interesting and comfortable interior design. The staff is very friendly as well as very attentive. The food (main dish - steak & salmon and dessert -creme brûlée ) was excellent. And the prices are reasonable too. It is definitely worth a visit!","50"
"Martin R","Nice, helpful staff (we arrived much too early), great food and exciting cocktails. Everything is done with thought and care. As some have pointed out, it is not very experimental or exotic, but when all the basic things are carried out well, it still makes a great experience.","40"
"ahe2015","Despite not having a reservation we did eventually manage to get a table for four on a busy Sunday evening. Service friendly and prompt. 2 meat , 1 fish and a vegetarian option (risotto) ; not an adventurous or particularly Scandinavian menu but between us we had them all and all were good, nicely presented. Reasonably priced for Copenhagen. Small choice of wine.","40"
"Phoenician2016","We were promptly greeted and seated. The maitre d'/manager was extremely helpful in interpreting the menu and the entrees were wonderfully inventive and delicious. The small size of the restaurant contributed to an intimate feeling, like dining with friends. The appetizers, as well as my orange duck and my wife's pork tenderloin (stuffed with goat cheese) were well prepared and VERY tasty. We cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.","50"
"stuartAnthony","Like you are possibly reading this now, we read the reviews to decide where to have an eveing meal in Copenhagen and we chose this as it was rated 4 in Copenhagen.  So why were we dissapointed?  Well, the food is fine, however it is pretty much international food cooked to a good standard, it was nothing special or interesting (I should say the steak was extremely well cooked (I mean nicely cooked rather than 'well done'))  The major issue for us is that it did not feel like you were in a restaurant in Copenhagen, you could have been anywhere in the world. I dont think we heard one scandinavian customer, we heard English, American, Eastern European etc, and the staff all spoke perfect English, some with Australian or non-scandinavian accents.  Was it bad in any way? NO. Would I recommend it, NO.  Sadly, I think Tripadvisor is becoming detriementall to being able to choose a nice restaurant.","30"

"silviadP2681BX","It's a quite small restaurant with almost 50 seats, better to book a table in advance. Good news is that it's opened till late (23) which is not that common in Copenhagen. The personnel is very kind and they will present to you the dishes you are ordering. There are only four main plates (steak, pork, salmon and duck), but they will satisfy your palate. The salmon tartar starter is amazing, as well as the salmon fillet and the steak. The dishes are even well disposed.","50"
"Links_25","After lots of research on trip advisor I booked this restaurant for my husbands birthday. I have to say it was well worth it, the service was brilliant and so friendly.

"Dana_sham","I was trying to plan ahead and book some restaurants for my weekend trip to Copenhagen- the reviews and the menu of the olive kitchen tempted me to book a table for our first evening meal. The menu itself is simple with not a lot of choice- however of the dishes we ordered, the food was delicious and very well done. I had the signature steak, and my bf the pork. Both were amazingly good, good quality ingredients and wonderful flavours. The chocolate fondant for dessert was decadent, rich and so yummy. The price was also very reasonable for the quality of food we received. Definitely visit if you are after a reasonably priced but delicious meal. Recommend you book ahead, we saw several people turned away.","50"
"RobinHouston_TX","Lives up to the star rating - nice atmosphere, excellent service and DELICIOUS. We tried every appetizer (My husband first said, ""why are you getting the mushroom soup too?"" Followed shortly by, ""this is the best mushroom soup I've ever had!"") Four of us shared 5 apps, 3 mains and a desert - two more people could have easily shared all of the goodness. Good selection of wine by the glass as well. We were fortunate to get in early without a reservation, but it filled quickly. Book ahead.","50"

"NorthsideBestside","+ good food. 4 or 5 options for each course, but each of them positive. + VERY good (english speaking) service, very friendly and helpful. I was pleasantly surprised (being used to German service, which is usually ok at best). + reasonable prices, our total was ~70€ each for 3 courses & cocktails. + the lychee cocktail.  - make a reservation, multiple couples without reservation got turned away during our dinner.  = I would recommend this restaurant to everybody looking for an informal dinner. It might not be fancy enough for a really 'chique' dinner, but everybody else will have a great evening with good food here.","50"
"Scoobbydoo","Went to this place after reading reviews on TA and weren't disappointed. Lovely ambiance and decor, very welcoming. We arrived at 7pm with no reservation, and thankfully got a table as someone hadn't arrived. Opted for the 4 course menu, including paired wines for me. Starter was a lovely salmon tartare. Next, mushrooms stuffed with crab. As this contained prawns and I'm allergic to them, I was offered alternatives for the a la carte. Opted for the ribs, they were delicious. Though my son assured me the mushrooms were better. Steaks followed, cooked to perfection with soooooo much flavour, then creme brûlée. All in, great value, tasted amazing, and the staff were really friendly, incredibly knowledgeable too, about the food and wine. Will definitely return, with a reservation made in advance!","50"

"janstegmann","We had booked a table but were running a bit late. Called the restaurant - no problem. We were welcomed by the owner and quickly seated. The positive impression lasted all through our visit - friendly and professional service all-around. The restaurant has a cool, rustique interior, which gives it a nice, urban atmosphere.   The food was just excellent - we had carpaccio and salmon tartare for starters and grilled salmon and risotto for mains. The risotto was augmented with a piece of grilled salmon on request - no problem here either (although an extra cost, but that is only fair). The taste was outstanding! Rounded off with a creme brulee - also really good. The overall impression was that all dishes tasted like basic ingredients - honest and home cooked. Excellent!   All-in-all a very good experience and we would not hesitate to return when visiting Copenhagen.","50"
"Aimee S","This place is full of American tourists, but it was one of the better meals we had in Copenhagen. The wine was good (we even found it later at BevMo in the states) and the dishes were mostly comfort food. My dad and I had the duck confit that was served with awesome mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce - it was like a fancy Thanksgiving dinner.  My sister had some steak, which was also very good.  The service was better than most places we visited in Amsterdam. Overall we were very happy!","40"

They did not serve the dessert wine that we paid for....Not importert for us, but a restaurant in this class......  Fix som small details = full score  We want to go back...  ","40"
"RamblingRambler","Super friendly staff, cosy ambiance and excellent food.

"Tomek86","After reading amazing reviews on TA and other social media sites I decided to visit this restaurant for dinner with a friend visiting.  We both went there with high expectations as the reviews were clearly positive.  We booked a table for 19:45...  After arriving and checking the menu it didn't take us more then 4-5 minutes to chose our food. We decided to try the 4-dish signature menu (changed the salmon tartar for beef carpaccio).  First dish arrived almost half hour later, at that time we started being a bit impatient as it took that long but hey it can happen, right? Still, putting a few slices of beef carpaccio on a plate with some rocket salad, drizzle with some truffle oil and sprinkle with red pepper and parmesan shouldn't take that long...  After eating the first starter we had to wait at least 15 minutes for them to collect the plates (way to long). After that we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for the second starter (crab meat stuffed mushrooms) and again we said hey it can happen, right ? But the worst thing was that after eating the second starter it took an HOUR to bring the main course (at that time we had been checking the time to make sure we were not exaggerating with being annoyed/ impatient).  The only dish that actually arrived in good time was the dessert (it took around 10 minutes). In my experience when you go to a good restaurant and you choose a signature menu it take max. 2 hours to have the entire meal served.  The food was really good, but the amount of time it took to be served was way to long. The problem was that they haven't even acknowledged that it was taking that long time... My patience was really questioned during that visit.  The 3 stars are only for the quality of food as the service was way too slow. They were either missing and extra waiter or short on staff in the kitchen.  I really hope this was only a one-time thing.","30"
"airmir","We were there because of the recommendations on tripadvisor. The food is alright for the prices, but far from the quality that is referred to among the other raters. The waiters are friendly, bit lack knowledge about the menu, the products, and the wines. They also forgot the wine we selected and explained our dish with: this is your meat and this is the rice that comes with it. It's alright for a night out, but not more!","30"
"chw861","The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Had a delicious three course set meal which had a good selection, and tasted absolutely delicious!

"ScandiBrits","Booked The Olive for a birthday dinner for a family of 6 on a Wednesday night. We saw plenty of others without reservations come in from the street and be turned away so bookings are highly recommended as this place has become extremely popular, not least due to its trip advisor ranking.  We all ordered the 4-course menu (by coincidence) - note that everyone at the table has to order it if chosen, so it may not always work out - but it was excellent value at 350 DKK per person excl wine. The a la carte menu looked excellent throughout and I would happily have chosen any of the dishes.  Everyone at the table was very satisfied with the quality of the food.  Service was excellent, particularly by Copenhagen standards which can be left wanting at times. The host was attentive and dealt quickly and professionally with an oversight by the waitress, who was otherwise great in every aspect.  Would and will go back, without hesitation.","40"
"Glenn-R_S","Really nice dinner for the four of us. Food, service and wine were great. We enjoyed the duck, salmon and the steak a lot. The servers did a great job and the pacing was right. Nice place. You could pay more at a tourist trap (we did earlier in the week!) but hard to beat this.","50"

"Valenciaker","Delicious food and fantastic service. For starters we had Copenhagen Dry Ribs. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. For main course we had Olive's Crispy Duck. A very well composed dish. The duck skin could have been a bit crisper, but everything else made you forget that. For dessert we had the French Vanilla Creme Brulee. Perfect consistency and blend of flavours. A subtile hint of liqourice made it really stand out.","50"

"Max N","The atmosphere of this restaurant is just amazing. The design is stylish and dark, perfect for a romantic dinner. We took the set menu and every course was delicous. The salmon tartar mixed perfectly with the rye bread and avocado cream, a nice acidic start. The filled mushrooms were very creamy and rich in taste. The steak was perfectly cooked and the scallop potatoes well-rounded. The only negative thing find was that I found the pepper sauce a bit too creamy and would maybe have enjoyed a red wine sauce insstead. Still, a very filling dish. The creme brulee was heavenly, the crisp sugar mixing perfectly with the cream. We enjoyed some cote du rhones rosé wine with the menu, which I can gladly recommend. Still, the best part of this restaurant was the service. The staff served with a smile each time and made jokes, making ourd dinner out most enjoyable.","50"
"Ingun F","We chose this 'little gem' on the basis of the Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed!!  We had the set four course meal, including the wines selected by the restaurant to complement the food which was excellent and good value.  The smoked salmon starter was delicious, the 3 mushrooms with 3 different cheeses was superp, the steak was absolutely fantastic.....good quality beef and cooked to perfection and the Creme Brûlée was devine.  The atmosphere was very pleasant and the decor nice, cosy and quirky.   The staff were very friendly, enthusiastic and explained the food and wine brilliantly.   It's in a quiet location......still near the main attractions.","50"

"johnsalmon111","I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary as it came with a strong recommendation from a friend. The service was faultless - each person that served us was very polite and friendly, our food choices were explained at the table and we have never had a meal before that was better timed in terms of meal spacing's. We didn't feel rushed at all despite the restaurant being full and had enough time to chat and enjoy our food and at the same time we didn't question why it was taking so long. It is so rare to find a restaurant that gets that right but The Olive Kitchen definitely got this right. The food tasted amazing and was prepared so well. We would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a nice meal in a nice setting. We will be coming back if we are in Denmark again.","50"
"glynnbob","Booked the Olive Kitchen for a 10th anniversary meal after reading TA reviews and wasn't disappointed.

We stopped in prior to our reservation time to ask to have it pushed back due to a flight/luggage delay and they could not have been more accommodating.

Highly recommend.","50"
"Dominic K","The food was great, and very flavourful. We had the duck, crab stuffed mushrooms and crème brulee. The service was great too and the décor was well done too. Great atmosphere. It's also not too pricey for Copenhagen, but be sure to make a reservation.","50"

"Carl R","We were visiting Copenhagen from the States (Florida) with friends and one of our friends suggested The Olive from other reviews! What a treat!  This is a small restaurant...which reflects casual elegance...yet relaxed at the same time. When we arrived, there were not many patrons however that soon changed as the restaurant became very busy...yet still remained quiet so you could enjoy your conversations! This is a terrific ""find""!  First, the service was incredible. The waiter explained the differences between the different wines...and made his descriptions understandable and easy. When it was time to order, he took the time to tell us where the dishes were from...and how each dish was prepared. I ordered the steak which was from New Zealand!   Everyone's dinner was fantastic! Again, I had the steak...it was wonderful and prepared differently from anything I have ever had before. My wife enjoyed the scallops...and she loved them. Everyone one truly enjoyed our dinner.  The waiter explained that they take much pride in the foods the purchase and the preparation and ""freshness"" of everything...it is all true too!  Deserts were excellent too! Everything was perfect...and when in Copenhagen again...we will return as each of us had nothing but a extremely positive experience from our visit! Thank you to our friend Susan for finding this ""gem"" in Copenhagen!  We were staying at the Marriott...so it was about a 10 minute taxis ride...and well worth it.","50"
"thrilledinmilford","We had read on TA that this restaurant was in the top ten and as TA is our bible we went to what would turn out to be the best restaurant l have been to in years. Krista is partners with her fiancé and they run it with love for there customers. The food melted in my mouth. I had the salmon tartare, the risotto, and the best cocktails I have ever had. It was something with passion fruit and maybe vodka I'm not sure but Krista's fiancé would know. Due to global warming we were there on June 3rd they were experiencing very hot weather the restaurant was warm and I went outside to get air and while I was sitting there Krista came out to see if I was alright. Just like America lol. She told me that they were installing air conditioning that Tuesday coming up. Hope that went well. I will go to Copenhagen for a long weekend on my way to Italy just to go back to the best servers, wonderful French chef and fabulous owners. P.S. I want a wedding invitation..lol.BTW, the only negative is the seating could be more comfortable against the wall. I sat in a seat so I was ok.","50"
"Cameron L","One of the best meals I could have possibly ever had. Great portions for the price (especially in Copenhagen). The steak and duck is to die for. Amazing and friendly staff. I can't wait to hopefully go back one day. For price reference for two people we each had 1 drink and 1 entree and it was 510 DKK (~$81).","50"

"Adelyne K","Limited menu selection but the food was excellent and good portion size too!! We decided to go for a 3 course meal instead of the 4 course menu - which was a great decision made. We had the beef carpaccio and Copenhagen dry ribs to start off with and it was such a good serving size, we had a hard time finishing it off. For mains we both had the steak - cook to perfection, just the way we like it! We have a hard time polishing off the desserts of creme brulee and self saucing chocolate biscuit between us we ended up being too full!!   Although the choices are limited, that did not stop us from enjoying what they had to offer. The restaurant is small in size with only a limited amount of tables - book early to avoid disappointment. Truly recommended!","50"
"CaptMakai","Hard to say enough great things about this restaurant! The stuffed mushroom caps filled with fresh crab meat and shrimp, the stuffed pork tenderloin presented with perfectly cooked fresh veggies, the brief but reasonably priced wine list all served with enthusiasm by people who are proud of their restaurant make for a winning combination!  Just around the corner from the very comfortable Hotel SKT Petri, this is a must in Copenhagen!","50"
"Maite C","Not to be missed. The menu is limited but every main course option is very interesting. As entrance we shared the delicious stuffed mushroom cups, filled with cheese; then my partner had the steak -he said it was unforgettable- and I had the grilled salmon, on a bed of spinach and quinoa, cooked to perfection. Excellent wines, at great prices. Espressos were excellent to (we had no desserts). Service extremely helpful and friendly, in a professional way. Nice ambiance, plenty of locals. The check was about a halve of we expected, after a week in Copenhagen. Open till 10 pm","50"
"Thpeet","After reading the reviews in the Tripadvisor app, we made a reservation at The Olive Kitchen & Bar. On their website we saw that they offered an Olive's 4 Course Menu for 350 DKK (approx. 47€) with Norwegian Salmon Tartar, Stuffed Mushroom Caps, Olive's Signature Steak and French Vanilla Creme Brûlée.  We had a great dinner and the service was super-friendly! The next time we visit Copenhagen, I already know where we go back for sure.","50"
"midnightsun01","You definitely need to order a table at this place since it is VERY popular. Lots of people got turned away while we ate our dinner. We ordered the Olive´s 4 course menu for 350 DKK. There was plenty of food at a fairly reasonable price. All the dishes tasted grood. The icing on the cake was the tender flank steak cooked to perfection if you like your meat medium rare. The scalloped potatoes were too dense, so I left half of them on my plate and concentrated on enjoying the steak instead.","40"

"lumosandnox1","Basically the title says it all. This is a good establishment that will likely get even better (it's only 4 months old) but it is ranked way too high on trip advisors Copenhagen restaurants. We went to 4 restaurants that were highly ranked, this was ranked the highest on TA but the lowest to us. The food was a decent selection and decently priced but the food was missing some flavor. My parents both had the duck and said the veggies were better than the duck itself. I had the pumpkin risotto and enjoyed the mountain of parmesan on top of it but the risotto itself was a bit over cooked. Our appetizers, the salmon tartar and the stuffed mushrooms were underwhelming. But there were two items on the menu that they did very right! The martini with olive infused vodka and sherry was very smooth and the chocolate lava cake had an amazing sauce with the ice cream!","40"
"Bradford P","Came upon this restaurant based on the Trip Advisor reviews. We both ordered the 4 course prix fix menu which included their signature dishes. Each course was described by the server. Food was artistically presented and pleasing to the palet. Excellent dining experience!","50"
"Allister F","I enjoyed an excellent meal at The Olive with a dozen friends. The service was fast and friendly, and the food truly delicious. Despite being quite a large group, the food service was fast enough, just right, not too quick or too slow. The staff were friendly and fun to chat with. The menu is very simple which makes choosing a dish quite easy, but the choice was still broad enough to cover all requirements. I recommend the steak!","50"
"860anniek","Friendly and helpful stuff, very good food. The only problem: you need definately a reservation. The restsurant is always booked.","50"
"Omphalos008","...and yet the restaurant and its staff had a quiet humility about them. The waitstaff was very polite and attentive; the decor was clean and modern; and the food was amazing! I had the Dry Ribs for my first course and as my server said, these ribs weren't dry at all. Succulent, flavorful and fall-off-the-bone are the words that come to mind when describing this perfect start to a wonderful meal. Next I had the Olive's Signature Steak; in one word - heavenly. The beef was ultra fresh, cooked to perfection and just melted in your mouth. Served with scalloped potatoes and asparagus on the side, this dish alone was worth the trip. For dessert I had the French Vanilla Crème Brulee. Simply a well executed classic. I will certainly be visiting again when I'm back in Copenhagen!","50"
"michael_bulman","My wife and I loved everything about our dinner here last night. The service was faultless. The staff whilst very knowledgable were friendly and warm.  The chef too was outstanding. Each meal was exquisite. The flavours worked perfectly together and each element of the dish was cooked to perfection. The place had a wonderful ambience.  Everything was reasonably priced, so I couldn't recommend or rate this restaurant any more highly.","50"
"897maxines","This is a small restaurant and bar, frequented by locals. That is always a good sign and the type of place I enjoy checking out as a tourist. If the wild mushroom soup is on the menu, order it. It was marvelous! I'd go back just for that. I'm a big fan of mushroom soup and have had numerous interpretations of it. We also had stuffed pork tenderloin and crispy duck with cranberry sauce. Both came with specially prepared mashed potatoes, were well prepared, and well-seasoned. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert.","40"

My girlfriend found The Olive online and we booked a table based on the reviews. We were not disappointed. The food and drink was to a high standard. The waitresses all spoke excellent English and they were the happiest staff I think I have ever seen, judging by the bright smiles they gave whenever they came to the table. Well worth a visit.","40"
"taralavoie","Booked in advance during a 3 night Copenhagen visit with my partner, we had pre booked after reading the reviews from trip advisor, we arrived 20 mins early for our table and thought it was worth a try to see if it was ready and luckily they were able to seat us, we both ordered the steak and it was one of the best I had, definitely filling! Didn't have any room for dessert but would have loved to have tried one as they looked amazing. Great presentation. Had great service from Antonio the waiter who was very informative about the food we ordered. I am very glad we chose to eat here, very reasonable priced as well.","40"
"Swiss_traveller018","Can't complain about anything here! We messed up the start time of our reservation but they were able to sort out a solution even though they were fully booked - then gave us a complimentary glass of cava due to the misunderstanding (fully on our part). So they handled it excellently.  Service was great - very friendly and personable. Food was fantastic! I had the dry rub starter followed by salmon and my husband had the salmon starter followed by the beef. I will be back to Copenhagen in September and plan to come back as overall it's an excellent choice!!","50"
"Marianna B","I typically find trip advisor to be very reliable, but they totally missed the mark on this restaurant. The service was very good. The food was average at best. It is rated 4 amongst over 1700 restaurants in Copenhagen. Not even close.  I ate at Radio Restaurant two nights ago. It is rated 7, they are not even in the same league. Radio Restaurant was out of this world. True gastronomic experience.  The Olive Kitchen and Bar advertise as being European, International, Danish and Scandinavian food. I brought a customer thinking it was Scandinavian based on the reviews. The waitress said, ""no we are are not Scandinavian, we are more fusion/North American.  I would suggest it is more like 850 out of 1700 restaurants in Copenhagen.","30"

"CustardV","We had read all the great reviews on TripAdvisor about this restaurant and I mentioned to my husband that I'd really like to try it for dinner, but expected we would have to book. We walked up from Rundetarn (the round tower) and my husband became all mysterious and would not tell me where we were going. A few minutes later we were outside the Olive and he asked if there was a table as we had not booked. Luckily they had a table that wasn't reserved. This was quite early, around 6.15pm. The staff were really lovely and friendly. We were seated at a candlelit table. It was still very bright and sunny outside, but very dark inside and it took a while to adjust to be able to read the menu. :-) The decor is lovely with wooden walls and clever, subtle lighting. All the starters were the same price as each other, ditto mains and desserts. Each main course was 175 DKK which equates to approximately £17. The desserts, I think, were 75DKK (around £7).  We chose the duck and the pork and both were amazing. The portions were perfectly sized and you were left feeling just right, not too full. Because of this we chose a dessert each. Creme brûlée and a chocolate fondant. The fondant is described on the menu as being 'self saucing chocolate biscuit with mocha cause'. This sounded very intriguing, but I was not disappointed to find it was actually a chocolate fondant with mocha sauce.  They offer unlimited water, still or sparkling, for 10 DKK (£1 ish). My husband wanted a glass of red wine, but wasn't sure which one was a light one so the waiter kindly let him try a bit first. You could not fault the service or the food and we were thrilled to have secured a table. It has earned its place as #3 in Copenhagen.","50"

"xhaventraveller","This was an excellent well executed meal and very good value for Copenhagen. We had less than 46 hours in the City so had chosen and booked this restaurant for Friday night. Unfortunately the latest we could get was 5.30pm but this suited well in the end. The 4 starters and main courses were all fantastic, well presented and described by the servers on arrival at the table. The accompanying wines were very good and well priced. The Rhubarb Daiquiri was fantastic! I would highly recommend this gem.","50"

"Gary306","Had a most enjoyable dinner last evening at The Olive Kitchen and Bar. The service was very attentive and pleasantly delivered with smiles and genuine caring. The Mushroom soup is outstanding, so very rich and delicious. Tip if you are also going to have the stuffed mushroom caps, enjoy them before the mushroom soup. The soup is so decadent, it may overwhelm the more delicate caps. The stuffed pork loin was delicious, a little over cooked for my taste, but I normally cook my pork tenderloin to 135 degrees.  A significant number of couples came in hoping to snag a table, but most were turned away given the popular nature of this restaurant, don't be disappointed make a reservation. The part-owner Krista, is an excellent hostess, with a charming smile and a keen eye for detail. It is hard to believe this restaurant is only four months old, as it delivers what most restaurant fail to do, combining a comfortable setting, attentive and pleasant service along with really excellent food.","50"
"Lisa R","We reserved a table for an early evening dinner on a Sunday in May. The restaurant was already busy at 6pm and had a lovely atmosphere. Our waitress was warm, friendly and very helpful (spoke perfect English!) and the service throughout was impeccable. The cocktail list was fantastic and the whole menu was very good value. We opted for main courses only, and both were cooked perfectly and presented beautifully (duck confit and salmon fillet). Really convenient location near Norreport station, and we will definitely go back on our next visit to Copenhagen. Highly recommended.","50"

"NeilChicago","I am always a little nervous revisiting a new find. But The Olive did not disappoint. Quite the contrary. It proved that my exceptional experience last month was not exceptional at all; fantastic food, delightful ambiance and warm, attentive service are clearly the norm here. I even repeated the same choices- Dry rub ribs and salmon and was equally delighted with the result. And still cannot get over the reasonable prices. Suggested to the owner that he decrease the portion size to increase his margin (they are incredibly generous.) I really want The Olive to succeed! Looking forward to my next visit here in three weeks.","50"

"NELLE1","Made a booking on line earlier the same day of visit, and following good reviews on TA. Nice ambiance. Menu is limited but varied. Very cordial staff. Noisy as it was very busy. Service was very good and the meals explained by the server. Very impressed by the quality, presentation and decent sized portions. Nice vibe. Felt classy and yet the prices were reasonable. Liked it so much we booked and returned 2 days later. Quieter this time and every bit as good as our first visit.","50"

"tgerber371","Both the food and the service are fantastic. We had a great meal in this very cozy rustic restaurant. We had the signature steak (Flank Steak) and the Pumpkin Risotto. Both dishes were excellent. If/when we make it back to Copenhagen, we'll definitely visit again.  Make sure to make reservations and this place is pretty much by reservation only.","50"

"WillemIII","We went to this restaurant because of the rave reviews.  The service was great, excellent -down to earth- staff who all spoke fluent English too.  All three of us had a starter which was great. The mushroom soup was excellent, the salmon tartare was good and the carpaccio was okay. Our main courses were similar, great steak, good pork and okay duck.  So, the food had different levels from great to okay.  The atmosphere was fantastic, a bit noisy. We were surprised there were not many Danish locals. That may be caused by the high TripAdvisor ranking.  We found this restaurant good, but definitely not the best in Copenhagen. The food was good, but a tad predictable. No real surprises.","40"
"Debbie A","I was in Copenhagen with a couple of colleagues on a work trip and we selected the Olive Kitchen based on the reviews. I was able to book very quickly online for a table 30 minutes later in the evening. Our booking was for 9pm and the restaurant was full when we arrived and when we left - very popular! We all ordered steak and were not disappointed - beware - rare steak is almost raw, so if you like it cooked a little bit more, go for medium. The staff were very friendly and helpful and there was a great atmosphere. Food was excellent. Only slight critique is that it was very noisy; there was one business man at a table further down the restaurant who was so loud we could hear every word he was saying! Not the fault of the restaurant but worth bearing in mind if you fancy a quiet intimate meal. I would definitely go back to the restaurant again.","50"

"DjinhRaoulK","Seeing this was number 1 on here for restaurants in Copenhagen, I wanted to try it out - I'm glad I did!  I had salmon on a bed of quinoa with mixed roast veg and a kumquat sauce.   The quinoa was cooked to perfection and the salmon was divine - the went together perfectly.  The kumquat sauce was an interesting addition which I felt worked well for the first few mouthfuls where the citric side really mellowed out the touch of salt in the salmon. However after a while the sharpness of the kumquat sauce proved to much for me.   This wasn't a problem as the dish wasn't doused in the sauce, the salmon and quinoa remained the main attraction.  I enjoyed the Crème brûlée for dessert - topped with fresh raspberries and strawberries. The vanilla flavoured innards were just right, light but firm enough to keep shape.   I'm flying back this week and if I have time I will be visiting again for sure!  ","50"

The service is amazing. The waitress even the owner came to introduce their food and wine to us. The food are probably one of the best we ever been to through our travels. The stuffed pork was juicy with the well balanced sauce. The config duck was amazing too, crispy outside and pink tender inside. It was served with mash potato, cabbage and cranberry sauce, absolutely delicious! Highly recommend to try this restaurant if you are visiting Copenhagen.","50"

"Lollyw81","On a short break to Copenhagen we wanted to pre book a great place to eat in the city. The Olive Kitchen came up as number 2 on the list in our Trip Advisor search and after reading the great reviews we booked!  The restaurant itself is easy to find and almost centrally located. For us, it was just a short walk from our hotel. We were welcomed by the friendly host and our waitress was over, had taken our order in good time. We didn't feel rushed at all!   The food was great quality, decent portion sizes and good value for money. To start we had the dry ribs, which were far from dry in terms of juiciness and the beef carpaccio. For main, my partner had the steak and I had the pumpkin risotto. Both were delicious but the flank steak was fantastic and I had serious food envy. Each course was served with a short explanation as to how it was prepared and placed together.   The restaurant was busy and the atmosphere was relaxed with a romantic feel.  We would visit here again and recommend. ","50"

"jdcBromley","Sometimes you only realise something is good when it stops being and so it was with Olive last eve. Firstly I have to say I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, although late in the evening, was pretty relaxed and chilled. Ambience is rustic cool with a touch of wine bar, comfy cushions on wood, mood lighting and good use of space. Like other reviewers I was greeted warmly by the (frankly stunning) waitresses and this continued through to the main course (see below). They gave good advice on what to order (the menu is not large - 5-6 dishes in each section). I had the stuffed mushrooms, tasty (but I couldn't get a flavour of the crab - just the cream & cheese) and a glass of very good Viognier. Main was a hearty plate of crispy duck leg with lovely mash and a glass of Zinfandel (again good). Having ordered another glass suddenly I noticed the ever present wait staff had dissappeared.....I finished my main and only when they came to clear the plate did I get to ask again for it, and so drank it with an excellent dessert of self sourcing biscuit (you need to see it). When I came to leave I saw myself out as the staff were all gathered by the bar chatting. I realise I may be being too harsh but when you raise the service bar high you have to live up to it and so it grates more if the level drops. Overal the food is very good home cooked fare - but not high end - but neither are the prices (650 DKK for me including service) so VFM is good. I will go back that's for sure. By comparison I only gave Musling 4 stars yesterday, and although the overal experience is a 4 star, the food is not at that level - but maybe its not trying to be. Whatever it is they are doing something right - 2nd in TA list....","40"

"Capri_lover2010","I was in Copenhagen for a short weekend on my own and, being new to the City and travelling solo, I wasn't sure where to eat on the Saturday night. I turned to trusty old TripAdvisor and this restaurant was rated number 1. Well, all I can say is that it met and exceeded every expectation of a restaurant ranked so highly. From the moment I phoned to make the reservation to the moment I walked in and found myself being shown to a table, I knew this was going to be a very nice experience indeed. And so it turned out to be. One always feels a little self conscious eating in public in a nice restaurant alone. At least, I always do. And yet, I was so well looked after and the waiting staff were so charming that all my anxieties of eating alone melted away. I actually really enjoyed myself. One member of the waiting staff in particular was utterly delightful. In fact, she was charm personified. That accolade goes to Lena. Thank you Lena for making me feel so special. You very thoughtfully gave me something to read while I was waiting for my starter. What a nice touch. That showed real class. A restaurant that puts themselves in the shoes of their customers and asks ""what can we do to make this a truly memorable experience?"" Wonderful! The food was delicious - cooked to perfection. The mushroom soup starter was the best I have ever tasted, anywhere. And the Norwegian salmon fillet just melted in the mouth. So well prepared. Unfortunately, time did not permit me to have a desert and I'm not sure I would have had room for one anyway but that just gives me a very fine excuse to return here the next time I am in Copenhagen, which I most certainly will. Just go - you won't regret it!","50"

"Bianca T","We tried the tasting menu which included a salmon ""ceviche"", stuffed crab mushroom, steak and lava cake.   1) Salmon was mushy, lacked acidity and was topped off with stale/dry toast.  2) Stuffed crab mushroom was littered with an unnecessary amount of cheese, totally overpowering the delicate crab meat. Parmesan cheese + cream cheese + mushrooms + crab meat does not make any sense.  3) Steak was very well cooked and straight forward. No complaints about this one.   4) Lava cake was too sweet and boring. Vanilla ice cream was tasteless. The best part about this was the fresh berries.   The service overall was friendly, but you felt pressured to eat rather quickly so they could push new customers in. Plates came out rushed and it didn't feel like there was time to enjoy the evening. Felt more like a get in and get out vibe.","30"

"thelittlebaer","We had appetizers, main courses, and desserts here. We highly recommend the salmon ceviche and stuffed mushroom caps as appetizers. The wrapped pork, seared salmon, and duck entrees were filling and delicious. But the chocolate cake with vanilla bourbon ice cream was the perfect finale. We all ordered one and ate it all, it was so legendary. The wait staff was so helpful and friendly, and we know they don't work for tips. It's all genuine desire to satisfy the customer. Also, ask for Will Smith the chef from Canada. He is charming and informative.","50"
"U6831JDandyh","I was recommended this place by a barman in a nearby bar as it had just opened. I was on my own and not only were Will and the team really welcoming, they made the whole evening by making you feel as though you were a regular.  The menu sounded amazing and my only regrets were that I didn't go feeling hungrier or that I had to leave Copenhagen and couldn't try more! I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  If you try only one place in Copenhagen - make sure you go to The Olive. Well worth a trip, and refreshingly inexpensive!","50"
"MarkWendover2013","I visited this restaurant with my wife and friends based on the Trip Advisor recommendations  We were not disappointed - actually we were delighted  The restaurant was warm, cosy, nicely laid out and full of atmosphere (but without being noisy). The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly  The menu has four choices for starters, mains and desserts but that was fine  For starters, we chose the mushrooms and salmon ceviche - both delicious  For mains we had steak, pork and salmon. Fantastic  For desserts we had the chocolate cake and the violet meringues. Excellent  Total bill including drinks was 1,400 Kr including tip which seemed excellent value  We were so glad we came here - we can't recommend this place highly enough and would definitely return","50"

The food was superb and we left very content and full!! You can visit their website for the menu. Absolutely worth seeking out.","50"
"Jan-Willem K","Finally a restaurant where they take food serious!  No Hamburgers on the menu, just properly cooked and tasty food made from ingredients you recognize and know are fresh.  The service is very enthusiastic and the atmosphere is great. A refreshing change between all the average restaurants in Copenhagen. The cook has kept the menu short to be able to excel in what he serves. You may want to check the menu beforehand to ensure there is something of you taste on there.","40"

I had a look inside and at the menu, and I'm very, very happy that I stayed and really, really enjoyed a fabulous steak and an even better chocolate fondant. The service exceeded my expectations. The staff was very kind and obliging. It's rare to come across such good restaurants by chance, but it's a very nice experience when it happens. As it said on the wall inside: Eat more of the food that makes you happy. I'd like to do just that again at The Olive some time.","50"

The staff were extremely knowledgeable and you could tell each and everyone of them were excited and just wanted to give you the best experience. This is one I will not forget and will absolutely be back. Food prices are extremely reasonable considering the food was one of the best I have had since visiting Copenhagen! My steak was done to perfection. Food was fresh! And so much flavour!  The owner visited our table which I thought was so great. He truly has a passion for this place which I know is going to do so well. Good luck on this new venture I would absolutely recommend this place to every person I know.","50"

Start off with some yummy cocktails (the daquiri and liqourice sour) and continue with some beautiful wines (the Zinfandel especially) to accompany the lovely food, especially the steak! Nice to finally find a place that serves proper food after 22 too.. Overall a charming new gem in Copenhagen with great food and drinks and the sweetest staff. Im already planning my next visit!","50"

"Iulia_Pavel","I was at The Olive Kitchen and Bar with my friends for the opening weekend. Everything is just amazing there from the cool interior design to the welcoming owners and the absolutely delicious food. People had such a good time chatting away their evening and enjoying everything about the place.   The owners couldn't be more welcoming and accommodating and their service is simply professional and top notch. The food is also up there along with everything else. I ordered the soup which was exactly what I needed that day and my friends ordered the Ceviche - lovely textures, the Risotto which was to die for, full of flavour and the Steak which was cooked perfectly. The bar serves very good drinks as well.  I could go on forever but really it's one of those place you just need to try for yourself. It has all the right ingredients. So a local or a tourist, don't miss out on a hyggelig (cozy) night out at The Olive.","50"
"Julai21","Gotta say this place is a keeper. Definitely goes in my favorites list.  First I was impressed by their opening "" pay what you want weekend"", need to really know what are you doing so you can go into the market with such a confident attitude. Good job guys.  Was a good environment also to get my baby with me too and not in the last, amazing food!","50"
"Arashie","I was there with my girlfriend on The second opening day. I heard about this place and went there to check it out, first thing I noticed was this; ""Eat more of what makes you happy"". Seeing such a thing and being in hospitality industry for 15 years and still running and managing couple of restaurants you would think, they either are very good at what they do or they just dream of being good. The concept was you eat what ever you want from the menu and pay what you feel worth it( drinks wasn't included). Atmosphere was full of energy, and was very cozy. We had two cocktails to start with which was very delicious and apparently cocktails made by an Aussie barman who manages and runs couple of famous bars in Copenhagen. I had a steak and my misses had fish, well seasoned and my steak was perfectly cooked as I requested. Quality of the food was very good and apparently everything is fresh made in their kitchen. Had a quick chat with the manager and owner who looked very young but apparently had a lot of experiences and worked all around the world and with big names such as Hard Rock Cafe and he dedicated his life to this industry and he explained that after working for big names and other people he decided to open his own place who makes guests happy to go there...! They want to create a good experience for people so they would remember their night by The Olive.","50"
"tomtomtom12345","Was there for dinner with friends on their opening weekend. Passionate and knowledgeable waiters/owners and perfectly cooked steak, I'll be back!","50"
"217kristapsk","We were a company of 5 dining here on the opening weekend and everything was top notch. Owners work as waiters too which brings an extra edge and they really answer every question you ask (my dinner partners were quite picky about the food) and you can tell they are very involved in everything that happens here. Their signature steak was cooked perfectly for my taste and the meat was one of the best I've tried. The competition in Copenhagen is extreme and there are some great places around but I'm sure the location, menu, prices (you'll be pleasantly surprised) and personality of this place will not leave you willing for more.","50"
