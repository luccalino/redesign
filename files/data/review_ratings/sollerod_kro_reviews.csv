"mogensen2018","The seven dishes that the dinner consisted of on this special evening - the annual Trimbach evening - harmonized in the finest style the accompanying wines. The atmosphere was top notch, serving discreet and friendly, the restaurant's style and atmosphere in a class of its own. Incomprehensible that Søllerød Kro only has a Michelin star - they deserve at least one more!","50"
"Hotfarm","Together with a group of business associates I had dinner here last week. The old inn is a little bit warn inside but you forget it instantly when you are seated with the menu which is full of super exiting menu suggestions and al’a carte dishes.   I had three dishes  @ Scallops in browned butter and hazelnuts @ Beef, beetroot, black currant, smoked marrow, roses & Caviar @ Selection of European cheeses  ... and additionally a wide range of miniature ‘snacks’ to start with and small cakes/ chocolates for the coffee.   All in all we had an fantastic evening in Søllerød Kro, with excellent food and exquisite wines and superb service from a group of very knowledgeable waiters.   Had it not been for the head waiter who was suffering from a serious cold and struggling while presenting the dishes, it would have been a perfect evening.  ","50"
"OleTr","I have visited Søllerød Kro many times over the years, so many that I will no longer review it in Børsen newspaper, where I am food critic. It is one of my absolute favourrites combining classic french gastronomy with a modest modern influence. Service may be the best in Denmark, is absolutely in the top 3, and the ambience is hyggelig.","50"
"Bulskov","The compositions of food and wine is definitly in a class of its own - elegant, delicious, and every course was signature of Jan, the Chef. The dedication of the staff was also in a class of its own.","50"
"JanochBarbro","Søllerød was chosen best restaurant in Drnmark by Spiseguiden in 2018. And this is the place to go for culinary delights! Go for a set menu, there are several available, from a couple of plates to 8 plus. Service is absolutely excellent, headed by rest manager Jan Restorff who is a true star, making everyone feel welcome as a VIP. Sommelier and servants are excellent too. Food is to die for. Perfect place for celebrations!","50"
"tiitu26","everything about this place is soo nice and a wonderful stay and the food is in high quality. Prob one of my favorite places, I have been to recently!","50"
"Aussieindk","Wonderful from start. Nice welcome, good seating.  Good ambiance and akustic offering easy cross table convesertions.  We dinned a la carte and enjoyed both meat and fish.  The service is well balanced. Attention without constant disturbance. Great information and selektion of good wines.  The food is tasteful and spectacular. Warm food on warm plates. Innovative dishes, challenging and surprising.   Worth the visit.","50"
"NewfMobile","We have visited a couple of times this past year, also with friends, and the food always surpass expectations! The wine list is simply outstanding, and Jan is always there with great recommendations!","50"
"Michael L","The food is of the highest quality and the village setting is lovely. But what really sets this place apart from the rest is the sheer friendliness of the staff. The sommelier is not only knowledgeable, he also revels in finding just the right wines for the table. There are no wine-pairings as in so many other places; it is a totally individualized experience. And you get the message from the moment you enter that everyone on staff wants to make this a happy and memorable occasion for you. We'll surely be back!","50"
"Fanny L","One of our favourite activities is to check out Michelin star restaurant. In DK we had visited more than a dozen over the years from Geranium, Noma to Kadeau and more. Sollerod Kro is definitely one that we would recommend. As expected the methods of cooking is classic French and ingredients selection are superb. Decor is aligned with the historic building, lots of attention to table/silver/glass wears, of course service is impeccable. We had their signature Sunday lunch plus one wine pairing and coffee. The cost is Kr2570/S$552 per head and 4 hours of great time","50"
"GetMyFood","I cannot say much other then try this restaurant and be happy with every minute that passes. I loved it and will be back again. Food and wine perfectly matched and I have commented many times on the need for place to get a real cellar master well Sollerod Kro you have that well in hand. I would not be surprised if they get a second star soon. Make sure you book and make sure you look at the prices before you go. Not expensive just not a cheap eat. Loved it and thanks again for an incredible time.","50"
"Bruce C","Our dinner here was excellent. Set in a beautiful historic old inn from 1677 which faces the local village pond. The interiors are beautiful as well as the paintings. There is a courtyard where you can have an aperitif.   We had the prix fix with wine pairings and it was excellent (the menu with wine pairings is attached here). Of course this restaurant has been a Michelin Star since 2007. We had wonderful service by Tórur Restorff and also Emily! Congratulations on perfect service and a memorable dining experience!  They have their own caviar, which was quite nice. Every serving was amazing.  It was well worth the 40 minute taxi ride from Copenhagen and the restaurant also helped get a return taxi for us. We would like to go back with more time to enjoy the surrounding town and pleasant walks.","50"
"linnealowdin","Marvelous evening dining 6 courses with gourmet flavors out of this world! It will cost you but what did you expect? It’s one of the best restaurants in the city!","50"
"RoteFuchs","Sollerod Kro is and has always been one of the best places to eat in Denmark. The old is charming, the interior up to date, the service professional and the wine list impressive but expensive. Despite what you should expect the food is inspired by the New Nordic Cusine and consists of a long array of small beautiful dishes that each compliment each other. Sollerod is an excellent place to eat if you like Nordic gourmet in a top class setting.","50"
"DienekeG3","after our biketour from kopenhagen, we ""earned"" an awesome lunch. worth the taff journey all the way","50"
"X6390NCmikes","We had the great fortune of eating at one of the great restaurants anywhere - Søllerød kro. We were treated to perfect service, a massive wine list, incredible creative and tasty food, and a comfortable, quiet setting in a building originally built in the 1600s. Our dinner lasted over four hours (although one does not have to stay that long). This experience does not come cheap — but is worth every penny.","50"
"Bill W","We celebrated our 50th Wedding Anniversary at Søllerød Kro in early May. They did an outstanding job in helping us organize the event. The food was spectacular, the service was professional and quite friendly.   This is a very special place and we highly recommend it for regular dining as well as planned events.","50"
"ChrisD8059","Great meal, and a tasting menu to remember. Sollerod amuse-bouche were the ambiance and the surroundings was exceptional, very warm service. Prices are a bit high but worth it.","50"
"CMSilfverberg","The restaurant maintained its one Michelin star for 2018 and proposed a 7 course set menu at a fixed price of 1000 D. kr.to celebrate this event.  For us it turned out to be a memorable event a little bit spoiled by the impression the restaurant used the occasion to get rid of unsellable wine from their wine sellar in stead of focusing on the optimal marriage of food and wine - a sport they are normally very good at.","40"
"mogensen2018","Fantastic evening - Trimbach dinner - the delicious dishes were accompanied by great Alsace wines from Trimbach. Great service, friendly atmosphere. Søllerød kro has one Michelin star - they really deserve more!","50"
"skovmeister","As a late christmas dinner we tried Søllerød kro, the food was wonderful, wine was the best we ever tried, and the service was exceptionel, fantastic taste, the sommerliers did a splendid job, everything was just extremely great, my best recommendations and a must try for gourmet’s and food lovers - it’s really clear that Søllerød knows what they are doing and they does this to perfection - Please do yourself a favour and try Søllerød, only my best recommendations.

"Peripatecian","Enjoyed different seasonal menus in this historic inn. Every dish was presented beautifully and the tastes and aromas were delightful.","40"
"Ccs133","This is my second visit to this restaurant but with a different chef. The restaurant is a bit of a trek from central Copenhagen but well worth the journey. The last time we had a tasting menu that was so extensive that we had to surrender with much regret as the food was wonderful. This time, we had the tasting menu and that worked well as the tasting menu was delicious (with many dishes duly covered with winter truffles). We received however, many amuse-bouche and they were tasty and interesting. My particular favourite was this little greenish apple roll with verbena which had such a nice clean flavour and which was one of many wonderful preludes to a great meal. What I particularly liked of the actual tasting menu was the ""in-house caviar"" (sollerod caviar en surprise) which actually masked sliced razor clams and a savoury panna cotta. This was followed by another dish also with caviar (oscietra/squid and mussel) but what I liked was the contrast of the two styles of caviar. This was followed by a wonderful dish of celeriac covered scallops and lemon. We did have an extra course of cheese and truffles, an indulgence that was well worth it. The turbot was good as was the beef and the listed menu dessert of Jerusalem Artichoke, hazelnuts and malt was delicious (and thankfully not heavy). At the dessert stage too, we were given many items not listed on the tasting menu which were wonderful. I loved my orange canele and the gold coloured chocolate bar. I also liked the little surprises in the additional desserts such as pomelo. Sollerod is a lovely warm setting for a great meal with a wonderful host in Jan Restorff and great food. Good ambience, pretty surroundings, great food, efficient, knowledgable, warm service- what more could you ask for? This is a restaurant well worth the visit","50"
"Anders H","Great place, great service and great food! Went for lunch, picked one of the tasting menus and had a formidable experience! It of course comes at a price, but this is one of those restaurants where you when evaluating the experience afterwards find that even though you paid a given amount it was'nt really that expensive when you put things in the correct perspective.Combine that with a great team of waiters etc and you've got a very attractive combination. It's about 30 minutes from central Copenhagen but definately worth the journey!","50"
"Staffan G","My wife and I recently re-visited Sollerod Kro which is one of our favourite restaurants. The Inn´s setting by a church in a quiet suburbian area just north of Copenhagen city centre is truly charming. Inside you are met with both relaxed ambiance and style. The food is out of this world with bold and creative flavours. Choose one of two set menus or go for the wide selection of à la carte dishes. Service is very professional, always with a smile and without any pretentiousness. This is luxury the Danish way!","50"
"Anne J","I had lunch with my daughter (she is a trained chef). We chose 4 items from the inspiration menu and a bottle of German Riesling. The meal was eventful (different small things came our way before and between courses) and very tasty. The service was very good.We felt welcome. I like the informality and the plurality. There were families enjoying Sunday lunch and business people tasting their way through the signature menu. It all worked due to the waiters, caring for everybody.","50"
"endoedibles","Located approximately thirty minutes outside of Copenhagen by car, an additional forty for those using a combination of Public Transportation and foot, Søllerød Kro is said by many to be one of Scandinavia’s very best Restaurants, the “White Guide” recently awarding it a top 5 position behind the likes of Michelin 3* Geranium and Maaemo in Oslo.  Described as “French Cuisine” using local ingredients, though recent reports of Chef Brian Mark Hansen’s cooking suggest an increasing element of New Nordic influence, Søllerød Kro is located inside of a 1677 Inn in the middle of a forest, the walk from the bus stop a pleasant one that takes no more than 15 minutes at a steady pace, though most guests during this particular meal appeared to be nearby locals or folks who made the drive from Copenhagen.  Awarded one Michelin Star since 2007 but with a lengthy history, part of that being a Sunday lunch tradition of opening up the space to families and kids of all ages, it was just prior to 11:45am that the first guests arrived at the lengthy white building in Holte, the early moments everything that fine dining should be with “Yes Sir and Yes Ma’am” aplenty and Champagne flowing, though what followed would probably be best described as a few steps above dining at one of the McDonald’s locations with an indoor playground.  For many a special event sort of Restaurant, the menu divided into a bargain Lunch and two Tasting menus, the Søllerød Signatur and Søllerød Inspiration at DKK1795 and 875, respectively, it seemed only appropriate as a first time visitor to place trust in the items on which the restaurant established itself, a Wine list said to be one of the best in all of Europe passed on in favor of one of Alain Milliat’s new Nectars, the pasteurized Cabernet Grape expressive and brisk in a way that pairs well with everything, though obviously a bit sweeter and less complex than serious oenophiles would appreciate.  Listed as an eight course menu, but in reality double that when accounting for several canapés, amuses, palate cleansers and mignardises along the way, it was just before the restaurant started to fill that things got started, a plastic ‘egg’ filled with boiled Potatoes, Summer Truffles and Bread Crumbs rich and creamy while the Asparagus in smoked Cream was a lot like that at AOC the night before, the small morsel of cured Duck around Prune a tasty balance of sweet and salty while the Apple compressed in Lemon Verbena was a refreshing single bite to refresh the palate for flavors to arrive next.  Offering what would turn out to be one of Denmark’s best Bread services at a pace best defined as brisk, a new Roll of either type delivered warm just as soon as the last bite of its predecessor was gone, it was with anything but a French classic that an amuse arrived featuring Watercress Ice Cream and immature Strawberries in a cold soup flavored with Parsley, the “Oscietra Unika En Surprise” that followed described as a Søllerød Kro ‘signature’ but in reality quite similar to something anyone who has dined at Joel Robuchon has experienced with a thin layer of sustainable Caviar stacked on Asparagus Gel and diced Razor Clams alongside a Horseradish Crisp.  Following up Caviar with more Caviar, the grilled Oyster topped in salty black Eggs specially produced for the Restaurant seemingly an odd decision to reuse a flavor profile so early on, course three was unfortunately a case of unnecessary ‘modernism’ creeping into the dining room, the nitrogen frozen Horseradish liberally added to a disc of Scallops topped in both Ginger and Grapefuit presenting a flavor so bitter and cutting that Hansen may as well have been serving Ground Chuck beneath it because no one would have noticed the difference.  Returning all but one bite of the dish to the kitchen, not one question or mention of it from the staff aside from “all finished?,” it was finally here that flavors got more interesting, the Lobster Tail served beneath softened Cabbage and Curry Foam infused with Thai Basil fairly spicy by Danish standards and yet another case of Chef Robuchon’s influence while the Foie Gras Torchon was a pleasant yet standard preparation putting the creamy quarter-hockey puck beneath Kumquat Jam and Dark Chocolate Crisps.   Clearly a restaurant dependent on using luxury ingredients to wow guests, a bronzed ounce of Turbot seared with Bear’s Garlic served next to a gelatin layer of Black Garlic atop Broad Beans coming next, savories finished with a slightly overcooked Loin of wild-shot Deer marinated in Black Pepper Reduction, the flavorless Summer Truffles served as a shredded cloud atop Cabbage more interesting as a texture than a taste beneath foamy Hollandaise.  Cleansing the palate with a warm cup of Lemon-Ginger Tea and a Macaron of complimentary flavor, a harmless little duo that arrived around 14h30 as several Danish children had long since been chasing up and down the aisles unrestrained by oblivious parents, Dessert one again took a post-noma turn by presenting halved-Cherries atop an Almond Caked next to a quenelle of fresh Woodruff Ice Cream, 2/3 of the Mignardises again featuring ingredients served no more than two courses prior while the Mango Popsicle intended to be dipped in White Chocolate was a fairly clumsy presentation that really did not seem to fit the meal’s concept.","20"
"Martin_the_Dane","I enjoyed a great six course meal with my mother here for lunch in July 2017.  The weather was great, so we could sit outside in the courtyard, surrounded by the inn on three sides, with the last side containing a glass covered seating area. The setup just works great, you are protected from the wind, and because it is a nice small village there is no traffic noise. I should add that inside is really nice as well, with several small cosy rooms making the experience very private and unique.  We took a six course meal, and got several extra starters. All the food was really tasty, the portion sizes were good as in most of the starters were small, but one starter and the main course was somewhat bigger. The end result was that it satisfied the appetite, but you did not feel to full. In any case, as with so many other star restaurants you can adjust that by deciding how much bread you eat. The bread is as expected really good.  The dishes are innovative, colourful and tasty, and as far as I am concerned the place is absolutely in the high end of the one star restaurants. And as said, the setup is unique, making it a special experience.  When we were there the restaurant leader Jan Restoff walked around in the courtyard, talked to the guests, and helped serve. We had a great chat with him, and with his help we managed to improve on a party booking we did for November. He gave some great suggestions, and overall we felt we really nailed that booking, effectively we managed to get a good selection of courses and wines in place, tailor made to our needs.  This place is pricey. But, there is a good selection of wines say at around 500 DKR, and you can get a three course meal for maybe around 400 DKR. But in fairness, this is not a place you go on a tight budget. Eating out in Denmark is fairly expensive, and the one star experience does cost extra.  But I warmly recommend a visit. Just seeing the small village and the area itself is an experience. I have been there a few times before, and I will visit again. Not that often, it is to expensive for that, but once in a while for a special occasion it is really great.","50"
"JBPurgerFrb","We talked about it and came to the conclusion that it was 22 years ago since we last visited Sollerod Kro. Then it was extremely nice with lobster soup, great beef and nice dessert ... now it is still extremely nice, but more in the Nordic area of food. Everything was great and we just had a wonderful evening ... thanks to the staff of Sollerod Kro. 6 course dinner with a lot of extra appetizers made our day :-)","50"
"FrankiBergen","Very good restaurant with 1 Michelin star outside Copenhagen. We went by bicycles from the centre of Copenhagen, and had a very nice ride. When we arrived at Søllerød kro, we where warmly welcomed by the waiters. We had a 3 course lunck menue with wine pairing, which was superb. This restaurant is highly worth a visit...or two.","50"
"Janice S","This one star Michelin restaurant is a hidden gem in a small village setting. We sat outside in a lovely courtyard. we had a price fix menu that included wine pairings. we actually had more than 3 courses as promised. They kept bringing out small bites in between the main courses. The food was amazing. service impeccable. so glad our travel coordinator booked this for us.","50"
"Geoff S","The service was impeccable. The quality of the produce was fantastic and the cooking was excellent. However the wow factor was missing, as was seasoning on a good few things. You do expect better in a Michelin starred restaurant. The flavours all mostly worked together in pleasing ways. There was nothing particularly innovative - everything was nice. But, I would suggest that yuzu with horseradish snow is a combination that is not nice- quite nasty actually. The taste was something like how rubber smells- not good.  The staff were friendly efficient and knowledgeable as well as fun. A great experience, but the food was good, but not amazing.","40"
"Naseal","The food was incredible. The service was even better. We had the inspired menu with wine pairing. You will not be disappointed. Worth the price.","50"

"Julie E","Visited Søllerød Kro for a family event in Dec 2016. Food was sublime with each dish looking like a piece of art! Staff very professional and helpful.   I brought with me a 1 year old + stroller, they were very helpful & let me park stroller inside in coatroom & had prepared table with a high-chair","50"

"Lone F","We had chosen Søllerød Kro for our 25 years anniversary with the family. This evening the chefs had a special 6 course Stardust dinner where they had free hands to create the excellent menu with corresponding wines. We did not know what to expect, but each course was a fantastic experience on its own.  The service was excellent and made us feel almost at home.  This was our first visit and we already look forward to our next visit.","50"
"JensPerregaard","I was at this great inn for a jubilee. We were a big group of 30 people and had a separate room. The service allows for uninterrupted conversion and fun but the staff is still present and you never lack anything.  The food is really something to travel for and it is presented in a manner for you to understand but without being pompous. I truely enjoyed the dinner and the evening","50"
"Staffan G","This Inn is one of our favourites in Copenhagen. Exquisite wines perfectly paired with superb food. Choose one of two set meals or go for the à la carte selection. The Inn itself is from 1677 and lies in a quiet suburban area just north of Copenhagen city centre. It is truly worth the taxi drive to enjoy this fantastic setting with an ambiance out of this world. My wife and I have savoured many memorable dinners here. The staff members are very professional yet both casual and relaxed. Elegance the Danish way you might say. Highly recommended!","50"
"Michel_Honore","Going to Søllerød Kro is not just a matter of stuffing of the belly. The place caters to your palates and fills you up on a gastronomical experience without pretence. The food obviously is nothing short of excellent, and well worth a detour. The Guide Micheling rating well-deserved. The service leaves nothing to wish for, everything is served perfectly, with attention to detail -but as with so many things Danish, without pretence. The staff will serve and smile -and add an appropriate joke ... if appropriate. Professional, but not tight. The setting is romantic, on top of a small hill in a 16th century inn, right on the edge of the forest, where a stroll before or after your meal might lead to an encounter with wild dear, or just a view of many of the calm little lakes and ponds in the area.","50"
"Christian L","We are impressed of the creative and wonderful food that was served, excellent taste and quality , We absolutly be back","50"
"Nete Keum J","To celebrate a private event I went to Soelleroed kro and I was not disappointed, on the contrary.   I had low expectations but was taken by surprise and awe by the great welcoming and friendly atmosphere in high season.  Seated in a quiet corner we could enjoy and talk without feeling monitored by waiters and other guests.   The dinner was served in a very professional manner and in a speed which took great care of each serving to rest and settle before serving the next dish.   My companion was more than excited about the steaming hot plates with the mains whereas I dwelled at the starter courses which were all season fish and shellfish, with crisp senses of today's catch.   Off course the restaurant started off with the signature starter, then playfully followed by a renewed version. All together the sense of an old man knowing how to play his instrument and the applaud was well deserved as both the caviar in a tin and the quenelle were perfect.   From the extensive and very impressive wine list we choose the 2010 Chablis, Butteaux from Raveneau.  It went all well throughout the grand signature menu.   What really surprised me and made me want to return once a month was the knowledge from the waiter that he offered to decant the wine and as we were ready to leave after the dinner, he offered to re-cork the remaining half bottle of wine to take home.  I take that as extremely great service to put the guest higher than own interests.   All together; if going for a Danish Michelin start restaurant, I highly recommend to order a taxi and go up north of Copenhagen and spoil yourself with the best of cooking skills and seasonal ingredients.","50"
"toronto23frank","Wow, what a setting ! What service ! We had an absolutely stunning delicious lunch outside in a country inn courtyard on a hot summer day ! ! All dishes were perfectly prepared as were the several amuse bouches ! ! The pace of service was perfect. We would highly recommend !!! It has earned its Michelin star !","50"

"383gilbertoc","Had the 4-course menu with wine pairing, like my wife. My daughter had a 3-course one. We all enjoyed our lunch enormously, and were stunned by the flavor combinations and intensity of some of the dishes. The lunch went on at our own pace, with the service always attentive to what we were ready for. We were the last to leave the place and never for a moment felt any sort of pressure. The restaurant looks very traditional, with a beautiful, classic look and careful, impeccable service to match. Cooking style is somewhere between classic French and modern Nordic, with a good fraction of fresh, tasty local ingredients, but also from the rest of Europe. Wonderful experience. Highly recommended.","50"
"RoteFuchs","Sollerod Kro has traditionally been the place you went to if you wanted to get really good high quality tasty food in and around Copenhagen. But it has changed. The interior of the restaurant is still very traditional (dull and a bit used) but the food has become much more Nordic than what used to be the trademark of this gourmet temple. Instead of tasty traditional dishes you now get fancy good looking Nordic food that is sure to impress on the plate but misses in the mouth. A temple has fallen.","40"
"17annen","Had a little private room for four persons. Started with four small complementaries - summer salad served in a bone and fresh, crispy asparagues. The starters with scallops and horse raddish creme. Main we had sweetbread and veal. For dessert the apple spring dessert and a selection of perfectly matured cheese. All in all a fantastic trip in taste-land, good and friendly service and cosy interieur. Would recommend this place to everyone that likes good food and good atmosphere.","50"

"Barbara W","Superb food and presentation, even when I just wandered in after visiting the church next door. (My ancestors came from Sollerod). I was fortunate that it was a slow evening and I was early, so the staff kindly seated me without a reservation. They then proceeded to treat me as if I were a treasured patron and served me a lovely dinner with a wide variety of flavors and textures. Being a teetotaler, I probably missed lots of the ambiance, though. And yes, it is expensive.","50"

"Bjorn O","We have wanted to try out Sollerod Kro for a long time, and finally managed to go there for lunch, the salmon, stuffed quail, and desert were all above expectation, and it just shows how hard restaurants outside France has to work for one michelin star. Delightful surroundings in the 300+ year old inn, excellent service, and the wine pairing was exceptionally good. Their lunch menus offer the best value, whereas the more extensive menu options are expensive, even by Danish standards. Highly Recommended.","50"
"sko_on_food","Everyone should be allowed to dine at Søllerød Kro in the Summertime were you are able to dine outside. Listening to the sizzling sound of the small fountain in the courtyard combined with the humming coming from Jan R. is simply the best way to start an evening. Everything is simply great!","50"
"GLOBETROTTER89","We were a party of four people and had the ”Søllerød signatur” menu for 1700 DKR without the wines, which were another 1200 DKR per person. We were situated in a private corner and the waiters – all very well-dressed and polite gave us a great experience. You are offered champagne as an extra welcome item, but since you get this for your first dish, it’s really too much, you’re really getting enough to drink during all the dishes. The menu is definitely one star Michelin level with a mix of “signatures” of Søllerød inspired by the French cuisine. The restaurant is located in an area of very wealthy Danes and I guess the restaurant charges what it can: I’ve never paid so much for food and wine menus in Denmark and I’ve tried the 2 star establishments too. Value for money is therefore not impressive, but the food is still really good!","40"
"Henrik T","Have been to this place on several occasions and has never been disappointed. The food is of very high quality, mixing classic French tradition with modern Danish cooking. try either a fixed menu or select some of their signature dishes. The Michelin Star is more than well deserved. The wine selection is huge and delightful, particularly Bourgogne, but if there is one small criticism from my side then it is that they do not offer a wine menu for the fixed menus, you have to buy per bottle (or from a smaller selection by the glass). Service is superb, well timed, attentive and top professional. The location is absolutely charming, an old inn from late 1600 which a nice gentle modern touch. If you have the time to travel 20 min North of Copenhagen - go for it.","50"
"kristin_cudahy","We hosted some Swedish friends at this charming inn, dating back to the 1700's. It is located about 20 minutes by cab north of Copenhagen and certainly deserves its One Michelin Star Rating! I would categorize the cuisine as Continental with a Scandinavian twist. We savored the six course tasting menu with wine pairings. Every bite was palate pleasing. Service was seamless and don't go if you are in a hurry! We luxuriated for about four hours over bright and fresh flavors perfectly matched with various wines from France, Italy, Spain and Austria. It is eye - wateringly expensive, but worth the treat for any true foodie! This was our second visit in two years. The first time was a beautiful June evening, so we sat outside under the covered pergola. This most recent visit, it was too cold for al fresco dining, so our party of six was seated in one of the rooms from the original inn. It was an intimate and cozy setting. Couldn't think of a nicer setting to treat some old family friends!","50"
"VagabondGourmand","Nestled in the quiet village of Søllerød, the restaurant of the same name deserves its one star - we went there as a family of 3 generations and 2 cultures to celebrate our daughter's graduation. She is a vegetarian and the kitchen adapted its inspiration menu to ensure that the eating experience was a special for her as everyone else. Impeccable service, the food was local, delicate, modern (but not too experimental, so all the family - from grand-kids to grandparents were thrilled). It was a glorious day, we could have eaten outside in the courtyard, but just took coffee there at the end of the meal. A charming place. I can imagine it would be just as enjoyable in any season.","50"
"kristin_cudahy","Set north of Copenhagen about 20 minutes by cab is a restaurant worth the journey. This is our second visit in two years and we have been thrilled with the dining experience. This one star Michelin restaurant was a former inn during the 1700's and the indoor dining includes rooms from the original structure. It is well - suited for couples or larger groups. Our first visit was in June and if the weather is nice, ask to be seated outside under their covered arbor; a very beautiful and atmospheric setting for fine dining. We were hosting some dear friends from Sweden and decided to opt for the 6 course tasting menu with the wine pairings. (It really ended up being more with amuse bouche, sorbets, chocolates, etc.) The service was excellent and nicely paced. We enjoyed perfect wine pairings from Alsace, France, Sicily, Italy and Austria. They were the perfect compliments to dishes such as Scallop with cucumber, cauliflower and horseradish; Lemon sole with ginger, grapefruit and curry; Squid with grilled salad soya and virgin butter; Iberico pork with sage and honey; Lamb with dried olives, baba ganoush, rams on and new potatoes, Lemon grass sorbet with woodruff, lime and wild flowers. The menu changes monthly and according to the freshest ingredients available. They have a very nice web site. We agreed that these were all palate popping, bright and perfectly crafted dishes. Don't go if you are in a hurry. Luxuriate in the experience and Bon Appetit! It is  eye - wateringly expensive, but we thought it was worth every Danish Kronor!","50"
"Lisa_Lawrie","This restaurant is amazing. I have visited the restaurant three times and the food is extraordinary. It is also very expensive, so make sure you can actually spare all the money on one evening. If you do decide to go there, you will never regret it! Danish cuisine at its best!","50"
"Piotr R","Some distance from Copenhagen but the drive is definitely worth it. The restaurant is located in a small, quiet town and the surroundings are beautiful. The food is modern, very, very good and quite expensive, even for Danish standards. As expected from a Michelin-grade restaurant - service, cleanliness and attention to details are impeccable.","50"
"tuneh2014","The place if you go for very conservative french cooking and service with stiff upperlip. And are willing to pay (bleed) for it. If you are a bit modern and like value for money there are many other places for you","30"
"Kkyriaki","We had booked at Soelleroed Kro for dinner and the whole experience really exceeded our expectations! It was a snowy evening and the village was in white, the restaurant had nice Christmas decorations and you felt like you were part of a fairytale. From the moment we were welcomed the warm, friendly but also professional atmosphere overwhelmed us. We chose to have the Christmas menu with wine pairing. The food was perfection and so were the wines. The restaurant manager and the sommelier are great people, willing to explain everything about Soelleroed's philosophy, the selection of the ingredients and the history of the unique wines that you can taste. We had a memorable dinner here and will definately return on our next visit to Denmark!","50"
"Jo Winding H","The restaurant is located in a cosy area 30 kms outside Copenhagen. The staff welcoming us were well informed and seemed to know who we were and assigning us to the right table without ever asking about bookings.  The wine list is incredible in its depth and broadness, especially in the classical regions such as Bdx, Bourgund and Champagne. The prices were not as impressive with a markup of at least twice the going retail price which is quite costly compared to high end wines in other good restaurants. We opted going for a VO from Selosse which served us well through the courses  We ordered the special 6 course christmas menue. The amount and quality of accompanying amouse bouche's were excellent - four in total in addition to petit fours at the end. Several of the courses were among the best I have had this year. Especially the cod and the young duck breast with endive.  This restaurant is well worth a large detour for the food aficionados out there!","50"
"Marco v","Enjoyed an excellent Sunday lunch here with matching juices. Beautiful restaurant in wooded surroundings. Fairly light and excellent dishes, and the pulled pork with cabbage leaves, walnut, hay cheese foam and freshly shaved black truffle, and the stuffed quail with morel and celeriac stood out in particular. The juices included a number of different grape varieties (chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon), elderberry juice, and fresh peach juice, all delicious.","50"
"ASJ-CPH","This restaurant is in a very old an historic inn, just north of Copenhagen. The food is WONDERFUL as is the service. I highly recommend it to everyone who can afford it (it's not cheap).","50"
"buratine","When I go to one star Michelin restaurant I expect that everything will be excellent.  I went there with my husband for our wedding anniversary dinner.  The atmosphere and service are perfect.  We choose the 6 dishes menu. The wines I got with my dishes were also very good. 4 of the dishes we liked a lot, the last 2 (the cod and the desert) were good but not amazing. Yes, we know that both dishes showed the cooks high level and they looked well but we could not really taste the cod and we think that desert was more suited for a hot summer evening, and not for a chilly autumn night.","40"
"Simmy_81","We emailed the restaurant in advance to give them a list of our allergies and the restaurant cooked a menu we could eat. It was our first wedding anniversary and we wanted to go somewhere special. Sollerod Kro was definitely that. Fantastic food and very well presented. The parking was easy and plentiful.The staff were very attentive. The full menu had a large selection and different price categories.   Only negative is that despite our allergies we were hoping for a slightly more exciting dessert.","40"
"SheldonHW","Our Danish friends took us to this Michelin Star restaurant when we visited Copenhagen from the States. They did not realise a Michelin Star restaurant comes with Michelin Star prices and were quite embarrassed about selecting such a pricey restaurant. I insisted on treating them as they had been showing us around Copenhagen all day.   Not too far from the city, but far enough to be secluded, Søllerød Kro is more like a handsome country road inn than a restaurant. Once within this idyllic getaway, you'll feel cut off from the outside world and allowed to relax.   All the cuisine was artistically presented and the supple flavours with unique combinations of fresh local Danish ingredients made our palettes sing. The service was impeccable and the waitstaff was affable and gracious, but not pretentious. No request of ours was too minor or required too much effort. It was clear to see the dual objectives of the owner and the chef were to please and pamper their welcome guests.  Since all the prices were in Danish Kroners, I couldn't make heads or tails out of the final check. However, when you get a bill in the ""thousands of Kroners"" DKK, you know you've invested a pretty penny in your sybaritic pleasures.   In summation, if you can afford to spend several hundred dollars on a lunch and understand dining in an establishment like this is as much about embracing a pleasurable experience as it is about the actual cuisine, I advise Søllerød Kro to be your ""must enjoy"" destination in the Copenhagen area.","50"
"Klara O","... If the worst thing you can say about a restaurant is that it has far too many waiters who attend to your every whim, even before you realize you have one. But that was my overriding impression, of course after savouring every bit of every course on the tasting menu and every sip of all the wines so carefully selected by the award-winning sommelier.. Thanks!","50"
"GrisVoyageurs","We had a very fine and remoantic lunch - as we have had before - at this very fine restaurant. The atmosphere is very friendly and the food is cooked to perfection. We sure come back Again.","50"
"tree3te","Soelleroed Kro was another beautiful dining experience during our weekend in Copenhagen. It has a more formal dining feeling to it with all the waiters in suits.   The first amuse bouche was a sugared flower with possibly a green puree in the middle with danish potatoes and peas covered in a garlic cream. The second amuse bouche we had was pine oil, celery bits, celeriac meringue with green tomato and green apple consommé.   Starter was salted salmon with a cold lemon sauce, the most delicious wild asparagus, salad, herbs and almond. Main course was turbot in a mussel sauce, asparagus, radish and some leaves. Pre-dessert was an intense orange/mandarin foam with a beautiful mousse and we had to pour the contents of a little bag into the glass. The bag had at least 4 different things: white chocolate, meringue, some orange coloured crispy things and others. Dessert was chocolate cake, strawberry sorbet and many other components. The light and beautiful coffee/chocolate cake that came with coffee was a nice ending to the meal.   We were pleasantly surprised how they would change our napkins each time any of us went to the toilet. The toilets upstairs were especially beautiful. We would return.","50"
"AnaCarolinaV","This is the restaurant in Denmark whose service really outstands. If you want to get full value of a dining experience, you will love Solerod Kro. Here you can sit and enjoy being pampered.  Food and wine is fantastic. Service is flawless. The restaurant is located in a very charming municipality near Copenhagen. It is worth the trip! There is obviously a not very modest price to pay. Nonetheless, this place always makes me feel good and never disappoints.","50"
"ToChiU","This restaurant truly deserves all the praise and prestige it is given. The food is of an outstandingly high quality and is cooked and presented with creativity and attention to detail.

"Georgios P","Although it is a bit far from the center of Copenhagen , approx 20km , or almost half an hour drive I did not regret my decision. The food is very good and the service is really top. Although I do not speak a word of Danish , the whole team would speak to me English and the manager, dressed as a cook would explain every dish. I did not expect that in a restaurant of that standard , they would prepare dishes that are not on the menu , just because asked. I would definitely recommend to wear a jacket , or even a tie, because Danes dress up although the restaurant does not have a dress code. You would rather feel unconfortable if you go in jeans and in my opinion you spoil the ambiance which is great","50"
"Azatoth","The food puts this restaurant in the absolute elite in Denmark. Not quite as experimental as the top restaurants in Copenhagen but same quality. The surroundings is much more charming though, and if you visit Denmark, you should travel the extra kilometers instead of eating at one of the international restaurants downtown. If you would like to bring your kids to a gourmet restaurant with a Michelin star, there is no better place than here. They have a Sunday family lunch at a great value every Sunday. Our kids loved the food. There is a special course for the kids, but they can have the same menu as the adults at a small extra charge, which our kids appreciated very much.","50"
"Mrboudin","Great food and service! Second time for this restaurant and it was excellent. No fuss just great food and Lovely service. Perfect start to our holiday. A big + is that they have many different menus to choose from.","50"
"fussybear55","Absolutely one of the best dining experiences I have had. The setting is beautiful, the interior of the inn is intimate, soothing, cosy. And the food.......our dishes were cooked to perfection, the chef had taken our order personally during one of his visits to the tables which we always appreciate. A most impressive Bourgogne (our favorite and the chef's favorite) wine list. Discreet and efficient service. Absolutely deserves its Michelin star, and not only for the food!","50"
"RNdinner","I have been lucky enough to visit this place quite a few times. And its always class. They have changed chef quite a few times over the years but still always kept same level of perfection and their michelin star. During the summer for lunch in their beautiful courtyard this place is unbeatable! And if you are lucky enough to be served by the restaurant manager Jan Restorff then you are in for a real treat. If you like caviar then dont miss their Caviar ""en surprise""! They probably also have the most impressive winelist in the country and have won several awads for best wine list in Denmark. Only downside is its slightly on the expensive side ( but still worth it ) and about 20-25 min outside centre of Copenhagen ( not necessarily a downside but keep in mind taxi costs if staying in Copenhagen city centre )..","50"
"Jes G","This restaurant is located 19 km north of Copenhagen in lovely, idyllic surroundings. An old etablishment, the old inn dates back to 1677 and has served as a restaurant for fine dining for decades.  The restaurant is very beautiful and intime, even so, it's quite large, there are rooms for both small and larger parties.   I was here as a boy, it was excellent then - and many years later, it's still magnificent.   We were a small group of three, celebrating birthday, and went for the four course menu with complementing wines. Each serving was magnificent, from lobster tail and cod to beef and a dessert of blueberries, crust and other details that simply blew me away! It was quite amazing and simply a creation made in heaven.  Besides the wonderful seating and cozy atmosphere, the service is top notch, thorough and pleasant.  The restaurants Michelin star is very well deserved!","50"
"liv_alexanndra","I always have High Expectations when it comes to fine dining in Denmark and again i was NOT dissapointed this Place is truly Amazing and Jan The chef is still around to every table with his professional approach. 6 out of 6 Star from us.","50"
"CaddyRussell","We at at Soelleroed Kro the weekend before last when we stayed in Copenhagen for our wedding anniversary. We got a train and taxi to the restaurant and when we arrived, the manager, Jan, greeted us and took our bags which was lovely. The food was all faultless and delicious - truly beautiful - and the flavours not overcomplicated in any way - everything worked perfectly, and each of the 4 courses (added cheese) were as good as each other. The service was exemplary. It is one of my favourite meals ever, maybe even the best. Given that we had Sunday lunch and wines and cheeses the overall cost was very good value. Thank you so much.","50"
"dioladetus","I rate this as top shelf restaurant of what Ive tried in Denmark. Its not all the way up there where Geranium is, but it equals Falsled kro, Kong Hans, Tinggarden & Miro and that caliber, and in a similar price range. Very good good with very great taste, and great service too. Highly recommended.","50"
"Lonech","Yes the food is excellent, perfectly done but is it worth the money to spend 4500kr for two (menu with wine, coffea, water), maby not. 4500kr (600euro) is a lot of money. You can eat there for less, and maby this is a better option, but remember to get advice abouth the wine choice, they have one of the largest winecards in DK, if not the largest. A lot of guests on the saturday night we went there. The courtyard is wunderfull to sitt in, but the building is over 300 years old som maby you should try this as well. The food is prepered to perfection and with some different elements that sounded strange, dill in a dessert? But it tasted just wunderfully. The waiters are very attentive and direction as what was intented with the dish and how to eat it was gives.... Its not danish kitchen with a large innovativ agenda, but rather a old-fashion one with a twist of moderne cuisine Would we go there again? Perhaps, but not with the full monty. It was a great experience to try the 6 course dinner, the portions wasnt big, but who needs big when you can have taste. We left full and happy in a taxi (its abouth 4km to the nearest station-Holte) 5 hours after arrival.","40"
"Tartiflette0450","There is no getting around it. It is one of the best restaurants in Denmark. My third time here and still an awesome experience. The reason why it cannot score top grade this time, was not because of the food, but rather the top winemenu. More than 1.600,-kr. and I would expect more. In Copenhagen it is possible to get much better value than here. This restaurant hasn't become worse, it has just be overtaken by the many new ones downtown.","40"
"Grifo","I was taken to Soelleroed Kro by a business contact 28 years ago and had fond memories of the experience, so where better to take my wife for lunch on a wet Copenhagen Sunday. As the restaurant is a 25 minute taxi ride from the city that extra cost needs to be taken into account, but it's worth it. The beautiful old building was just as I remembered it as was the elegant understated interior. All the restaurant staff were highly professional and courteous and all spoke excellent English, the service throughout was exemplary and the timing was perfect.....and the lunch, it was just superb, everything cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. It is so nice to not be disappointed when re-living an old memory, and to finally give my wife the opportunity to experience somewhere that I had been eulogising about for so long and she too loved everything about it!","50"
"NilsMS","I have visited this restaurant the last 30 years and is still more than impressed by their professional skills on all areas. From the reseption till you leave, like in heaven, you will have had a feeling of perfection from everyone of the employees, all inclusive. The food and wine is first class. I have never been disappointed of the efforts from the kitchen. The food is classical but innovative and full of pleasent surprises to challenge your taste. The restaurant is situated in the most spectacular part of Holte north of Copenhagen. Yoy will feel the utmost tranquillity and spesial atmosphere at any time of the year. Try this place: Do as the composer Edvard Grieg. He lived 10 years of his life in Denmark. One of his favorite places was this restaurant. He composed his famous piano comcerto at the museum in the vicinity of the restaurant.","50"
"99unlimited","I've eaten here several times and it has always been a superb experience. The staff are very friendly and skilled. The food, needless to say, perfect. On this sunny, Sunday afternoon, we had fish with a glass Sauvignon Blanc. The match was perfect. This place is far away from public transportation, therefore I recommend a Taxi from the station, or from your hotel.","50"
"MaHoDe","This was our second time to Søllerød Kro. The first was an amazing New Year's Eve celebration. We wanted to return to see if Sunday brunch would be as delicious. We were not disappointed. Superb service, every course done to perfection, and great advice on the wine even with a table full of very knowledgeable wine people. Pricey, however, the prix fixe Sunday brunch is a very good value. A really special dining experience! Also explore the grounds of this beautifully located restaurant.","50"
"bartholdy","The set menu offers a very good value for money (if you can talk about that at this price level). Several awesome dishes. The wines were divine. So leave the car at home. But beware that public trnasportation in the area is .. not optimal  Unfortunately one of the dishes (the fish) had a bit to much salt. A pity - and the sole reason I can only give 4/5.","40"
"KiwiRoadrunner","The food was absolutely fantastic. We had the 4 course Sollerod menu with matching wines (and added in a cheese course for a bit of fun before the dessert). Each dish was beautifully prepared and tasted delicious. There was a bit of playfulness with molecular gastronomy without being over the top and being the focus - the fresh ingredients still stood out. Each dish had different flavours and techniques which was a nice touch so you didn't feel you were eating the same thing over and over but with different ingredients.  What really sets Sollerod apart though is the service. Our 'waiter/sommelier' (""Henri"" - although I suspect it's spelt differently in Danish!) was out of this world. If you are the chef at a great restaurant, he's the kind of person you want front of house to ensure the guests not only enjoy the food but also have a great experience. Henri was able to answer the several questions we asked about food preparation for our various dishes and he always knew the answer (in English!)! His wine pairings were lovely, too.  The ambiance is nice - absolutely professional service that still managed to be approachable and personal without being stuffy and formal. You felt like you had your own space which was nice. It's a short (20min) drive outside the city centre with a dedicated car park out back. The building is from the 1600s so lends a nice atmosphere.  Smart casual seemed to be the dress code - some dresses/suits but several people in jeans and casual clothing, too. Yes, it's expensive, but this is the first Michelin starred restaurant we've been to in the last 2 weeks (our 4th now) that we actually felt deserved the star.","50"
"supertraveller_dk","I just spent a couple of hours dining in the cosy yard. As usual the service was second to none, the food and wine perfect, and the sunshine and the warm weather made this another night to remember. Go there! It's not exactly cheap - we paid EUR 350 for two persons (Champagne, wine, four course-dinner, coffee etc.) - but it's worth every penny.","50"
"Woodturner","The food was good but definitely not worth the 200+ euro price tag. I had just dined the previous nite at another place and had an awesome meal for one quarter of the price. And yes the wine prices are outrageous. Not on my recommendations list.","30"
"AddieHeidenDK","This is located in a quiet area north of Copenhagen, but well worth the trip. Service is impeccable (it should as they have almost a waiter each per table), the dishes were not only great looking, but tasted wonderful. The set-menu of 4 gave a you a good sampling of the menu, but I was definately full afterwards. The interior is very pleasant with people seated in several different rooms, nicely spaced, and the noise level is very pleasant.","50"
"supertraveller_dk","We went there (for the 50th time - or more) to celebrate a wedding with 12 friends.  It was excellent. From the time you book the event and sit together with Mr. Restorff, the manager until you depart after an excellent evening... Every detail regarding the food, wine, water, coffee, personal service etc. etc. is simply top op the line.  Just go - don't think. Go!  A tip: The garden is perfect on at warm summer day - or evening.","50"
"MichaelFleischer","Søllerød Kro is always a fantastic and very nice experience – This was probably my 7th og 8th time in as many years and the restaurant managed to keep a very high standard. We all had had a la carte – I had 3 courses plus cheese and everything was excellent. The Caviar was perfect, the Roasted turbot was just great and the apple inspired desert was just perfect. The wine list is almost to big but there is something for everybody. It’s a thrill to come back again and again and again.","50"

"klitgaardj","I went to Søllerød kro with high high expectations and they were fully met and then some.   My friends and I took the prestige menu plus an additional course and asked the waiter to pick a wine menu to go along. All courses were flawless and so exceptional in taste. From caviar, lobster, oyster, foie gras and truffle. It was all there and they really made the most of it. The wine menu was not exception and we were served some true treats.   The chef Jan joined our table in several occasions sharing his stories about food and describing the dishes to come with a lot of passion. It added a very personal touch to our visit as he did not seem to do that with the other guests.  It is hard to describe the experience but I would recommend this place to anyone. The price is up there but it's worth it and I'm coming back again!","50"
"hansmiddelburg","This was our second experience in this restaurant. The food was excellent, no doubt. We know that Denmark is a very expensive country but this felt like crazy. We went on one of the Christmas days and there were only menu's at unbelievable prices. It might be a small thing but the still water that we ordered was also at a crazy price. After one sip we got a refill and with our glasses still full there was a new and opened bottle on the table without asking if we wanted a new one. We drank only a little from this bottle and obviously it was on the bill. The wine prices are also extremely high compared to the same wine in other restaurants. All in all it felt slightly like we were being robbed after an evening where prices were the discussion of the evening. Last but not least, staff could be a little more friendly. Very formal, no smiles.","30"
"PubLover7","We've been here 3 times and loved it every time. The last time was with my parents in law and the chef was very amenable and substituted things on request. Impeccable service, you really feel cossetted, and each dish is so lovingly prepared. Can't wait to return!","50"

Very romantic, excellent service, creative food and amazing wine. The location is spectacular as well in a lovely 16th century inn. Well worth the 30 minute drive from Copenhagen","50"
"juliannachong","It is worth the journey out of Copenhagen. Our cab pulled into a cul de sac and the windows of the restaurant inn were warmly lit up, offering a glimpse of the diners inside, & the roof had just a touch of snow dusting.  Maybe they were short handed or maybe it is the danish way but nobody greeted us at the reception and we had to hang our own coats. but then everything else improved from that point, thankfully.  Service in the restaurant was prompt, professional and efficient, if not warm or personable. but the chef, who made rounds of the tables throughout our meal was both personable and enlightened, to our delight. he should personally see to the training of his staff. service is so much a part of the whole restaurant experience.  The food is of the type that i love. hearty exquisite fare that verges on heavy, but so well executed that you wouldn't mind indulging - particularly as most modern danish restaurants we tried were a tad light .  The house malt bread and danish buttermilk butter were sublime and the waitress was diligently and generously topping up the bread without being intrusive.  Our menu had cod, duck, monkfish or sweetbread (the latter of which was wonderful) and a dessert - all executed with a refined classic touch. although, the dessert was uninspiring after a rather good meal.   Overall, a sure and safe choice for a lovely meal particularly for those who don't want a modern hit or miss kitchen experience.","40"
"BigSur707","Went here for a business lunch. The restaurant is next to a village a few miles outside of Copenhagen. The building dates back to the 17th century. Very well refurbished, elegant, and cosy inside. The staff where very attentive and all spoke English. The Chef walked around the dinning room several times and spoke to the guests. Chatted with us for about 10 minutes. The food is EXCELLENT. The portions are not very large, but the food is great. A good place either for a business lunch or for a special occasion in the evenings. Not a place really for families with small children. The only downside is that it is pretty expensive. They do offer set menus at lunch though which are reasonably priced.","50"

Honnestly speaking the starter and the fish were not to my satisfaction. The starter was haddock with Lobster and horseradish: you did not taste at all the haddock and lobster as there was too much horseradish on it. Afterwards the fish was monkfish but it was grilled. And at least my piece tasted more like burned fish than fresh fish. Also disappointed. After that we had pigeon and finishing off with two desserts; these last three dishes were ok. But the overall service was very good, and the chef was very friendly. I guess it was one of those days the kitchendid not meet expectations which honnestly speaking for a one star michelin restaurant (and the accompanying prices) it is really not acceptable.","30"

"Anastasianekrasova","After I have read all the reviews I desired to go there. It was mistake. Food is nothing to talk about. Eggs everywhere ,sorbet is so frozen that You can't eat it without having pain in teeth. We were 4 and every one had the same feeling so its nothing about our teeth. Chicken fond as soup is not the best idea. Nothing about gastronomy. One good thing- wine list is a wine book in fact. One of the best I have ever seen. That is why I put 3 . For the food I give 1. Do not forget that when You think to go there the taxi price should be added - for us it was 340 dek each way. We were leaving in the center. So we were 4 and paid 5700 plus 680 - so we have paid 6380 dek. For this money You can get so much better quality!!!!","30"
"torbenDenmark","I and 13 other friends visited Soelleroed Kro (in Danish: Søllerød Kro) a few weeks ago. We had an absolutely fantastic dinner. We started at 7 pm and left the inn around midnight.  I cannot remember the number of dishes we had - accompanied by an extensive wine menu (8 different wines). But I remember the surroundings (a beautiful inn), the service (excellent), the food (exquisite) and the wines (out of this world).   The combination of wine and food was 100% delicious and very tasty.   I will not repeat the menu - and it is not necessary. I dare to claim that every dish served in this inn is just fantastic. We have been to the place several times and it is getting better and better every time.  Just one thing - bring a lot of money! This type of food and wine costs you a small fortune ...","50"
"JanochBarbro","Had the chance to have a long Sunday lunch together with visiting Italian friends at Sölleröd kro. Since the excellent chef Jan knew our Italian friends, we got special attention (not that I think that anyone would get anything less). Chef got to choose menu and wines, so we ended up having 8 dishes and the same number of wines (by the glass). Quality and presentation was excellent, so words are superfluous. Noma is still our very special favourite in Denmark (and the world, come to that) but this is not far behind - which is a tremendous compliment.","50"
"globeric","Went to celebrate my wife's birthday. Restaurant located in an old farm house. Beautiful location and would imagine that on a warm day in Summer it would be even better. My wife decided on the menu and the food was super - clealy inspired by modern French cooking but in no way pretentious and everything tasted good. Perfect service, attentive but unobtrusive and the food was introduced in detail. The male waiters were dressed in black business suits which seemed quite funny and reminded me of work. It was not a cheap place but the price was definitely reasonable for such a restaurant. We will definitely be back.","50"
"traveller88888london","Excellent, Excellent, Excellent! Great food and ambience. I would definitely recommend.","50"
"Mugxi","Have been there several times and it is fantastic. However it is also priced up to a level a little above the actual you pay for.","50"
"PeterPostLundsgaard","I come very often to Søllerød Kro, maybe once per month or every second month. I have never been disappointed which is pretty good as I always have high expectations as I do rate this restaurant to be the best in Denmark.  The wine card of Søllerød is known as the best in the country and i find the pricing fair","50"
"charylg2015","My husband I went last night. It is located outside Copenhagen about 20 kms (350dkrs each way) but well worth it. The restaurant is quite charming. We ordered the Prestige prix fixed menu which was noted as 6 courses but is really 9. The food was excellent and matched by exceptional service. It is clearly expensive but again well worth it. We would go again without question.","50"
"Birck","Great honest food with a great wine selection in a perfect thanks to the host and waiters.","50"
"BHayes1","I have eaten the best meal I've ever eaten in a restaurant, in this restaurant. The most complete presentation, food quality, diversity. Yes it was expensive. Even for Danes, its considered expensive. If you've an occasion you are prepared to splurge for, this is it!","50"
"Palmeroa","Well, the interior is a bit old fashion and certainly not ""danish design"". But the cook is good, no doubts. And the reinterpretation of nordic food in a modern key is not bad either. We had a set menu, leaning on the fish side, and...More","40"
"supertraveller_dk","This is THE restaurant. I eat there with my wife and business relations once in a while. It is without any doubt the most stable and perfect experience you can have in any restaurant. Polite but not snobbish. High, high quality but not too complex...More","50"
