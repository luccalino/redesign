rlrobles5,The staff were very welcoming from the moment we walked in. We also had a chance to practice our Italian! The food was good. I had the cod with was done nicely. The kitchen was very nice about accommodating gluten and lactose intolerances. Wine by the glass was moderately priced (or expensive). Decent selection as well.,40
veebee54,"We visited this restaurant on the strength of the reviews and wish we had never bothered. Very friendly staff however the food was served in exceedingly small portions - tuna pasta = a small amount at the bottom of the bowl, ditto the tenderloin which came wiith a miniscule side of rocket and parmesan cheese. The white wine I ordered was a mere splash in the bottom of the wine glass. We were still hungry but decided to cut our losses as we figured the desserts would be likewise tiny so we got the bill. I guess we shouldn't have been suprised really - the price for each splash of wine was kr85!! Total was kr610 for a miniscule amount of food and drink. We were still hungry and went to McDonalds for dessert..would not recommend Trattoria SUD despite the glowing reviews it has on TA.",10
922DavidD922,"We went on a Friday night and sat next to a 15 person table of brits out on a stag weekend. So it was boisterous, crowded, and slow. However, after a few spilled drinks we made friends and it was fine. After they were fond Andreas , the owner, apologized to everyone for the noise, had one of the waiters sing a quiet,beautiful song and gave us a glass of wine!  We ordered the 3 course menu ( s45) . Their special antipasto arrives on a large wooden plank and is good but very attention getting. Both our pasta dishes were very good ( one white and one red) with subtle flavors in each. Tiramisu dessert. All good in a friendly bistro atmosphere.  A very nice neighborhood place with good wine, friendly staff and home cooked Italian food at reasonable prices, for Denmark!",50
GiuliaChiaraP1,"Come sentirsi a casa in una città straniera! I'm Italian and I eat in this restaurant for dinner the fantastic ravioli. Restaurant found casually but that surprised us: excellent cuisine, service worthy of attention and Italian warmth. Andrea, the owner, welcomed us even though it was closed and offered us a special limoncello at the end of the dinner. We will absolutely return! 5 stars for the all staff!!!",50
Stian O,"The atmosphere at Trattoria SUD is great! And so is the food. Had the Antipasti Al Tagliere as a starters, and it is served on an plank, and it is very good! For main I had TAGLIATELLE AL RAGÚ DI CINGHIALE, which is very simple, but very tasty. The tiramisu is almost as good as the best I`ve had i Rome.",40
Brian B,"I called to have a table ready. No problem. Ordered veggie spaghetti with mushroom & onion, but received ravioli with mushroom fill - no sauce. I decided to keep it, to not make a fuss, and ask them to put together a tomato sauce with something veggie in it. No problem. They took back the white, sauceless ravioli, and Brad back really nice dish with the same ravioli covered with a tomato eggplant sauce. It was delicious. Far more inviting than the white ravioli w/ mushroom fill. They should put this on the menu! Andrea, head waiter was awfully busy, but still fulfilling his entertainment and greeting role. He brought out a free drink which he enjoyed with us in comp, and it was all good fun. Thoroughly enjoyable. Parking can be difficult in that area. Take a bike. Do it!",40
TainatPit,"I had lovely dinner with my best friends! Personel were very friendly and caring, food (tapas, pasta, tiramisu) very good. Trattoria was full of happy people. Great choise for spenging time with friends!",40

LadyLinda05,"We arrived for our first visit to Copenhagen at 4pm from Heathrow and was sitting in this restaurant at 7.30pm. Lovely friendly staff, great atmosphere, wonderful food and wine, it was packed out, Tuesday night. Very impressed, we shared a shrimp salad starter and steak and guinea fowl mains, brilliant. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and return.",50

921stephend,"While walking past this attractive restaurant on a Sunday evening we decided to see if a table was free, we were in luck. The service from start to finish was excellent. The food was the best we had in Copenhagen. In particular the whole sole fish was excellent. Can’t recommend any higher.",50
MaureenErn,Amazing atmosphere and fabulous food and great service. We were attending a birthday celebration. We started with the antipasto. I chose the tuna as main course and it was superb. As dessert I went for the Tiramisu. Highly recommended.,50
769rolfh,"We take our chances and give top score at first visit. Fantastic italian food, nice surroundings and a fantastic service. Everybody loved their work and served with passion. They also took the time to sit down and talk to us after the meal. You should go there, and we will be back. A real taste of Italy!!!!!!! Torill, Edel and Rolf from Norway",50
JanP3947,"Very Italian experience -- I enjoyed an ad-hoc dinner on a business trip at Trattoria and was positively surprised despite having chosen the venue for the bets reviews in this neighborhood. The food was excellent and the suggestions of the team were all spot-on -- I enjoyed the fish of the day and an antipasti plate, which was customized since some other dishes were out. The nice team offered a good-bye drink and I left in a good mood with a very positive first impression of the Italian community in Copenhagen!",50
LuxuriousNomad,The food here took me by surprise such was its quality. Without a doubt the best Italian restaurant in Copenhagen. It really helped make our evening very special and the servers were very courteous and well presented.,40
X9553BQrafaelg,"We strongly recommend your visit at Trattotia Sud due the great food, nice environment and fantastic service provided directly for the careful owners! We will cretainly recommend to our friends who intend to come out to visit Copenhagen",50
2019FAnnette,We had so much fun at this restaurant! Loved how the food and drink presentation was entertaining! Andrea was an amazing host. Thank you!,50
doshi07,"The staff are pretty disorganised, service was slow and pasta was noting special. We weren’t asked if we enjoyed our food. (Which we didn’t) waiter didn’t write down your order and forgot what the order was and had to recheck (with every customer). We wasn’t asked if we wanted anything else, I.e. coffee desert and it had been 30 minutes after finishing dinner (our plates remained on the table). The waiter was distracted the entire time and every time you tried to ask him a question he would stop mid way through conversation and start talking to other staff. So we decided to pay and leave. We was not offered our £9 change for 2 pastas and had to ask for this on the way out. I have no idea how they have managed to get their good reviews I would describe it as disorganised lack of service and really average food. Such a shame as we saved this for our last night after reading the reviews and will be leaving with a bitter taste!",10
Jorge A,"We chose this restaurant to have our wedding lunch celebration. We can't be more happy with our decision: Excellent food, beautiful decoration, and very friendly staff! Andrea is an incredible host. I recommend Trattoria Sud to everybody!",50

Owen T,"We arrived in Copenhagen without a plan on a Monday night and looked up where was good to eat on TA. SUD was the first place that grabbed our attention and we are so glad that it did!  Luca was our waiter and he was generous and friendly and explained everything clearly.  We had the 4 course meal for 2 with a glass of Prosecco each and a bottle of wine (Rapassi) this ended up being over £175 which is not cheap at all but the food was out of this world.  We started with an Antipasti board with a great selection of salads and meatballs and sea salt and rosemary bread to die for. Then came the best course and one I understand they are famous for, the mushroom and sausage pasta with fennel, I can't do justice to how good this dish was in writing, you will have to try it for yourself. The entrecote steak was next and again could not have been cooked better absolutely melt in your mouth with so much flavour! Lastly (even though we didn't have room was a panna cotta with mandarin jelly on top, a great pallet cleanser.  This meal was one of the best I have had and although it was eye wateringly expensive I would go back tomorrow.  Treat yourself, it is worth it!",50
juan jose frede... a,"Gracias por todo!  Its nice to see that family owned restaurants can still thrive in this city where the ""Nerd""ics tell you whats hot or where is worth to go.   grandmother´s style food, basic and not pretentious. I nice place to go and have a good time out. This is a ""restaurant"" where you go out and ""eat"" No instagram or foodies style. I ll be back. Which is what matters.   Thank you o the italian siblings  Hasta la proxima",50
778helenab,"Found this on tripadvisor and booked a table way in advance. And that was lucky because the place was crowded, lovely noisy and good atmosphere. And that standard for the food as well, both pasta, entrecote and the lamm. The only mistake was not checking the bill before we paid as they had charge us 3 menues instead of separate dishes. The wine was great and Italian beer is never wrong. Recommended!",40
GioBrando7,"What an amazing Restaurant. Situated in the heart of Copenhagen, we enjoyed so much everything. We had a warm welcome from the professional and very polite Andrea and her waiteress Tiziana is very dynamic,helpful and sweet. The food was so delicious, we ate an amazing selection of delicious and beautifully presented antipasti and followed by "" Stinco di Agnello con Polenta"" and Sole with Patoetos and Spinach..... We didn't think we would have room for dessert but the delicate and complex Pannacotta is a must. A fabulous evening.....well done!!!!",50
pveeg,"Do yourself a favor and eat at Trattoria SUD. This family owned restaurant is great. The food was presented is an amazing way and fabulous!!! So too was the service; personal, friendly, and super attentive.  My colleague had the pasta with ragu...so delicious. I had a three course dinner option. The appetizers came on a wood slab & the presentation was beautiful to look at and better to eat. It was supposed to be a standard starter but the Chef & server customized it. For main I had the tuna. Panacotta for dessert.  Everything was over the top except the price. Super reasonable.  Do yourself a favor and eat at SUD.",50
PV147,"Excellent service, very good Italian food and nice atmosphere. Certainly worth of visiting! 4 portion dinner was lovely, everybody enjoyed, wine list is not too long, but serves well.",50
TeWe,"Chose this restaurant based on the good reviews and were not disappointed, everything was just perfect.  They have an a la carte list and different menus based on how much you want to eat. My wife chose the lightest one, Menu Sud while I chose Menu Nord where the difference is you can choose meat or fish as a main course instead of pasta.  The starter was the same for both and it was stunning. They brought in a huge wooden plate with the most delicious antipasti you can imagine.  Dessert was maybe not on the highest level set by the previous courses but still good.  A special mention goes to the fantastic atmosphere, while service was perfect everything was still really relaxed. To finish it off while we were waiting for the bill the owner sat down to offer us a warm sambuca prepared by the table.  Considering that the bill was very reasonable taking into account what we got we left with a big smile on our faces.  This is the way to do it !",50

xplorer751,This restaurant is in the city center of Copenhagen. The service was warm and generous. This is the best meal I have had in a long time. Flavor were bursting with everything. I cannot imagine better prepared food. I had Mama's pasta and chocolate plum pudding with flaming Sambuca. I cannot give a restaurant any higher recommendation than this.,50
Mo11oyr,First night in Copenhagen. Really glad we booked this great little place all based on trip advisor reviews. There is a excellent atmosphere with food and service match. We sat in the window and watch the world ride by,50
denmcloughlin,Service was very friendly and the food was lovely. I’d recommend it strongly. Try the chef’s starter which is taster for the starter menu!,50
MattiasGun,Okey food and good services. Norhing special about the restaurant. Price is okey. But i will say that it's not a restaurant you will go back to if you have been to it once,30
kirstineML,I was eating her on Saturday the 5/1-19 with my sister and her husband! Never have I tasted SO GOOD FOOD! Every bit was a piece of heaven! The staff was so friendly and helpful! It was very professional! Simply just an amazing experience! It’s not the last time I’m visiting this amazing restaurant! I’m a fan!,50
LexCH16,"Unfortunately have to say that have expected much more based on other users’ opinions but got disappointed. Although reservation was easily made online, we felt stressed from the very first moment we entered the restaurant. It’s most likely the policy of the restaurant to have as much guest turnover as possible and therefore not the staff’s fault, but it was hectic the whole time and we did not really feel welcome (not even when they took our order). And this was during the week, not even on a weekend.   The food was OK but nothing extraordinary in my opinion, price/value good. So overall an average experience",30
454dimitrism,Very nice stuff and the owner very helpful. The food with no a lot of choices but very tasteful. The starters was very delicious and also the plate that is famous for. It is a good choice if you want to Italian in Copenhagen,40
JacquiCPH,"A wonderful cosy restaurant in the heart of Copenhagen with the best service I've experienced in 15 years of living in Denmark. The food is great and the 'antipasto misto' may look expensive, but it has to be seen to be believed. A wonderful selection of different things to taste and savour laid out on a huge plank of wood set high on your table with metal stands. Couldn't recommend this place more highly and most definitely NOT a tourist trap.",50

jqthach2016,"Me and my wife ordered the antipasta starter for 2, the starter had many delicious foods on a wooden plank. Im sure this is a favorite here for most guest.  We also ordered a bolognese spagetti, and the mama's pasta, which where both delicious.  The only complaint that I have which removed the 1 star was the staff, a tall younger gentleman with glasses. When he brought things to our table he would drop it on the table loudly, maybe I am I too sensitive about this. But then when he pours our sparkling water into our glass, it would splash on the table. Also when we were paying our bill, while the credit card machine is pending the charge, he tapped his fingers on the table impatiently. Maybe I am the one that is too overly sensitive but I feel this young gentleman has an carefree attitude which will give off a very bad impression. If you cannot pour my expensive water carefully, then let me pour my own water. If you spilled the water by accident, then at least wipe the table. I am not done, when we asked him for the desert menu, he brings us the menu and throws in on the table without saying anything and walks away. I feel at least tell us, ok here is the options of desserts, what would you like? When he comes back, we say we don't need desserts we are ready for the check, he replies to us ""then why you tell me to bring you the desserts menu?"". Am I still too sensitive?  If I see this kind of service in Mcdonalds I don't care. This isn't a fast food restaurant and we are not paying fast food price. I am sure the owner wants this restaurant to be the best it can be and this young gentleman needs to watch his attitude in order for this place to be a true 5 star.  Other than that , The food is great. DO EAT HERE.",40

rachelpW1787CB,"We stopped here on a Sunday night after finding that most places in Copenhagen are closed on Sunday. The restaurant itself is beautiful with plenty of comfortable outdoor seating. My husband and I had an incredible antipasti appetizer (it’s huge!!), the sausage and mushroom pasta (his mom’s recipe), and the bolognese. Everything was light and delicious. The owner was a lot of fun and we ended up staying for hours. Definitely recommend!!",50
capecodnana2016,"Trattoria Sud is not just another Italian restaurant in Copenhagen. The owner Andrea is from Napoli and he treats each guest as a family member coming home. The antipasto appetizer for sharing comes on a 3 foot wooden plank with a bowl of mussels, Italian meats, steak tartare, cod bites cooked in tomato sauce with pignoli nuts and more. I wish I could have included a dramatic video of our pasta course prepared tableside inside a scooped out wheel of parmesan cheese softened with a torch to make a delicious sauce for the pasta. Mama Mia! Just go to Copenhagen so you can let Andrea and his fine Napoli chef prepare you the best dinner north of Italy.",50
Terence M,"A lively atmosphere, the Antipasti al Tagliere was excellent - particularly the sliced veal in tuna sauce(!) Good wine choices. Table service and hospitality were wonderful - Luca took great care of us!",50
vancityjoanna,Wandered in 9pm after a long flight from Vancouver. Antipasti was recommended and turned out to be lovely. Kids split a spaghetti Bolognese (not on menu but they were happy to whip up). Our pastas were top-notch. Tiramisu in a teacup finished the meal perfectly. Would recommend.,50
Sara G,Me and my sister visited and we both had pasta for dinner. Very tasty and genuinely Italian. If it wasn’t for the train we had to catch we would have wanted to try the tiramisù which looked amazing. Nice staff and good atmosphere 👌🏻,40
CoralynG,"Two weeks ago we had lunch in Copenhagen at a burger place and were looking for a taxi to return to the hotel. We were with my mother, who is 86 and tires easily. And we were standing on the street corner, with no taxis available. After about 10 minutes, a woman crossed the street and asked us if we were looking for a taxi -- she said that they were hard to find at that time of day. She offered to help us by calling a taxi, and said we could wait at her restaurant across the street. She took my mother's arm, helped her across the street, seated her at a table, got her water and a blanket and then went to call us a taxi. You just don't find this kind of kindness many places -- particularly when we had not even eaten at her restaurant. She would not accept a tip when we left, so we told her that when we returned from our cruise that we would come to eat at her restaurant.  Two weeks later, we came for lunch. And are we glad that we did!!!!! The food was amazing. We eat ordered the 3 course lunch, and the first course was a huge appetizer board filled with hot and cold offerings. My favorties were the fritatta (excellent combination of flavors), the eggplant, the veal tonada, and the roast pork, but all were good. For pasta, I think the Mama's pasta was the best -- but each were flavorful and well executed. And all three desserts were very good -- not to heavy. The pistachio ice cream had a wonderful texture and flavor.  This is a family run effort. The front of the house is fun by the woman who helped us, with assistance from her mother. Her husband manages the restaurant and his brother is the chef. It is well-worth a stop if you are in Copenhagen. The food, and the friendliness, cannot be beat.",50
MissPollysShoes,"We found this restaurant by accident while looking for somewhere that was still open near our hotel and what a great find!  I had fish of the day which was naturally gluten free, it was cooked perfectly. My sister had the wild boar pasta which she said was delicious. I had panna cotta for dessert which unfortunately came out with biscuit bits sprinkled on top, the waiter apologised and brought me a fresh one minus the biscuit bits. My sister had the chocolate dessert and both desserts were lovely.  The night we were there the waiter and chef were on their own and while it mean't a slightly longer wait we were only too pleased to have found somewhere open and after a day of sightseeing it was great to be able to sit and relax before eating.  The hospitality was top notch and the waiter did a great job making sure everyone had what they needed. Towards the end of the evening blankets were brought out to all the tables still sitting outside, this was a lovely touch as none of us had to ask for them.",50

When we went for lunch the previous day we had the Bolognese spaghetti which was just like my grandma’s. The ambiance at this eatery is warm and friendly.
