"dbcglobal","Did it take a while to get a booking? Yes. Is it expensive? Yes. So if you’re going to wait so long to go to someplace to spend a lot of money, it better be worth it. Geranium does not disappoint!  My wife and I visited for just a couple’s meal, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Not pretentious, but professional. Attentive, but not overwhelming. Just the right level of comfort and cordiality. Oh, and the food and wine pairings were spectacular.   I can try to outline the many dishes, and how the pairing options were equally attractive. But it’s just easier to say it’s well worth it if you get the chance!","50"
"jameshT4626LW","We've had the great pleasure of eating in some wonderful places. Top rated, michelin stars including many of the Top 10 of the San Pellegrino lists. The day before, we ate at Noma, and yes, it was completely extraordinary. And whilst Noma deservedly earns its reputation through the foraging menu of secrets and the unknown, Geranium deserves it through sheer delight in taste. Every single thing we ate or drank was bewilderingly delicious. It carries as much mystery and magic in its presentation as the best, but it really does delight at the taste. For me, this is one of the Top 5 we've ever eaten at and we can not recommend it enough.","50"
"schmidtmg","We went to Geranium with high expectations - these were all me and even surpassed. From the moment of arrival to leaving three and a half hours later, it was a memorable dining experience. Our daughter (10) was asked whether she wanted an adaptation of the 16 course menu, but she chose the full menu and was delighted to have done so. The menu consists of 16 bites and small plates, with beautifully balanced flavours and superb ingredients. The wine list is among the largest I have seen (Robuchon au Dome in Macao excepted), and you find wines of great rarity (and the price to match) here. The first vintage of Screaming Eagle will ruin anyone but an oligarch, but the Kongsgaard Chardonnay 2013 we had was superb. Very good also was the glass of Ridge Syrah I had with the lamb course. Service is superb, the waiters and apprentices knowledgeable about every dish. The sommelier gave us a tour of the premises and impressive wine cellar. Overall this was one of the 3-4 four best dining experiences I can remember....... upon return home, I looked for a retailer who has Kongsgaard in its 'assortiment' and ordered a few bottles....","50"
"jdefordsky","My husband and I went to Geranium with another couple while on a trip to Copenhagen. We went here the night before we went to Noma and honestly, this restaurant was better.   The 17 courses were perfectly spaced out. The service was impeccable and it was almost like a symphony when the staff brought out each dish. At one point I asked the person to let me take a video of them pouring the sauce on my dish, and even after he paused for a second he jumped back into sync with the rest of the servers.   We sat at the fireplace table which was the best seat in the house. Mid-meal they gave us a tour of their test dining room, wine cellar, meat locker and kitchen. It's a bit oddly located but the food is to die for. You MUST book a reservation here during your stay in Copenhagen.","50"
"andersbj81","We have dined in several three star Michelin restaurants in both Europe and n. America, but Geranium is probably ranks amongst the best we have had the pleasure of visiting.   The 16 course menu did have some forgettable entries, but they were in the minority. Our favorite was a round slice of Hake bathed in a fantastic butter/herb sauce with caviar, and a beautifully presented knife shell in a remade, edible shell.   Service was good and friendly, and we got a nice tour of the restaurant. The wine pairings can get quite expensive ($300 - $2200), but the “cheapest” one did not disappoint, so it will probably be sufficient for most.","50"
"MH865","This is by far the best dining experience in Copenhagen; 16 little stops in the menu and a great and not excessive wine tasting menu to accompany it. Beautifully presented, a young and dynamic - and very knowledgeable staff. Great execution. Food as art and clearly the kitchen puts its heart into it!","50"
"804acer","The food was beautifully presented, and delicious. But what stands out is not the food, but the service. Knowledgeable staff, with a passion for their work. We truly enjoyed our evening, and we really appreciated the tour of the restaurant. Excellent wine collection.","50"
"videokrubban","If you are going to eat at one fine dining-restaurant in Copenhagen, then this is the one. The wonderful reception from the staff, the food is amazing, the wine is out of this world. Please, this is not your ordinary restaurant-visit. This is something else. This is Art in its pure form. An overwhelming experience. A plus is that you can enjoy a visit in their kitchen and wine-cellar before the dessert. Very nice. Thank you.","50"
"S W","Geranium offers a warm, friendly atmosphere and an exploration of Nordic cuisine that is brilliantly conceived, beautifully executed and a pleasure to enjoy. The staff is excellent and the restaurant is notably generous in providing for the welfare of their guests. The tasting menu begins by laying out the pure, distilled, fresh flavors that are a hallmark of Nordic fine dining, then builds on them to introduce layers of complexity with varied levels of flavors and texture. The delicious food is both familiar and new, subtle while inviting thought and exploration. The world class wine list offers a selection of wine pairings, some of the best I have seen anywhere. On the higher end (yes, this can get very expensive, but in line with current prices for genuine “rarities,”), some once in a lifetime wines are on offer. Prices are high but comparable to other “best of the best” experiences (I see this as a category rather than there being only one at the top) in a very expensive city.","50"
"andreaspL9709KW","A lifetime experience! Every course was a work of art! Juice pairing as an alternative was even better than wine! We are grateful for the opportunity tasting such spectacular food!","50"
"S H","Went to this restaurant for lunch today, it was a 4 hour extravaganza, I knew it was expensive but I seriously didn't expect to be wowed as much as I was.   The service & welcome you get out of the slowest office lift is a good indication. The weather was horrid, cold & wet, but once you're in the restaurant your mood is lifted.  I didn't expect the food to come out so quickly and in constant succession. There was only approx. 8 tables occupied, but the food is a work of art and SO tasty. The service is very attentive.   And even if you're on your own, like a man was, you're not made to feel like you're friendless.   You're asked if you'd like a tour of the restaurant, you get to walk through the wine cellar, checkout the aging if the meats, go to the back of house where chef's were making my desserts.   Overall a really surprising and pleasant experience. Even though it is very expensive I think I'd like to go back there again. And have already recommended it to my friends!!","50"
"Rawdonchick","We were seated at the chefs table, which is situated just off the kitchen. At any one time there are 20-30 chefs on, so it makes for some amazing viewing first hand of how the kitchen works. But the table is pleasant and whilst you feel like you’re in the action, it doesn’t get hot or overwhelming there. The service was impeccable and the kitchen staff ran like a well oiled machine. It was nice to see how pleasant all the staff were to one another as well as the customers. The deg meal was exquisite (even for a non foodie as myself) and not overwhelming with seafood (which some def meals tend to do). Presentation of the meals was amazing.","50"
"TalyM_12","This is not dinner. It’s a lifetime experience. 16 dreamy and creative courses, a tour in the restaurant, wonderful staff. A once in a lifetime experience.","50"
"2001NH","We really enjoyed Geranium - especially when we saw the head chef Rasmus Kofoed eating in a tiny nook table near us! The food was thoughtful and innovative in combination. I loved the mushroom, walnut, pear, truffle soup. Like loved. I could have ate a whole gallon of it! The oyster, the roasted vegetables, and the marbled hake were all standouts in a wonderful menu. The desserts were all light and flavorful- nothing heavy or dense. Service was excellent as well. A truly lovely experience","50"
"ManateR","We were told not to miss this restaurant and we were glad we didn’t. Their food might not be as bold nor fun as their counterparts but Ramus’s team were skillful and their meal was amazing. The location was at the football stadium and office building which is unique. The price was what we expected.  Beside their food which was delicious, their services and attentions to detail were top. They were kind and has real passion to give their customers great experience. Highly recommend !!","40"
"cassidia952","Dining at Geranium was such an amazing experience! The staff were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. The presentation of each dish was incredible, and there were so many unique flavors and combinations. My boyfriend and I got the juice pairing with lunch and the corresponded wonderfully. A tour of the kitchens was also part of the experience. I would definitely recommend an experience like this at least once!","50"
"Katie M","The staff are very attentive but not intrusive and the chefs bring many of the plates to the table. Relaxed and informal which you rarely see in three star Michelins (take note France). Tasting menu was perfectly balanced and unlike Noma which we'd been to the day before was identifiable food rather than trying too hard to be ultra left field and often failing.","50"
"lottehweber","We had the best dinner experience we could wish for. I was absolutely amazing. The staff, the god, the wine, the location it was just perfect.","50"
"otheroulli","I liked the food very much but not every dish which I messaged the restaurant my thoughts on this. That being said this is a nice restaurant with a great ambiance. Wear something nice and expect to stay a while. Expect a high bill as Denmark is pricey. Nice touch with tour of wine and kitchen. Friendly but professional staff. Knowledgeable wine experts. I basically did not want to pay those exorbitant prices for a pairing so I picked two wines and an after dessert wine. It was under 100 bucks as I told them the max I wanted to spend. I have no qualms about this. Lol. They found excellent wines to pair with the tasting menu. One friend is dairy free and they were aware and had tasty alternatives. He had a cider and it was huge that his wife split it with him. Another cost effective way to have a libation without breaking the bank on drinks. I do wish they had a cheaper wine pairing like el cellar de can roca. Need to be more aware of wiping crumbs from the table. They will call a cab for you. Overall a much more welcoming experience than my greeting at Noma and it’s sister restaurant. Chef who even though he seemed a bit shy indulged me with a photo which I appreciated. I would go back if in Denmark.","50"
"outrageouslyfoody","The restaurant has a very elegant design which helps to showcase the experience and the Bocuse Trophy. The food overall is good but is mainly the experience that catch my attention, the service is elegant and rapid as it should be. Great wine selection for a three stars, I would have expected less classic and more modern, but maybe that’s the way it has to be.  Would I go back?  I don’t know.","40"
"ferzsofi","I visited the restaurant with two friends of mine and we all agreed that the the whole experience was absolutely worth it. The service was impeccable and we loved our dining journey. We also took the basic wine pairing with our meal that greatly enhanced our enjoyment. I particularly loved that while it was super professional it was also rather laid back and had a warm atmosphere. The little touches including a tour of the restaurant were appreciated. We spent about 4 hours in the restaurant that is so well choreographed that we didn't even feel that hours have gone past.  Thank you for our beyond excellent evening.","50"
"N1929YLjohnw","Geranium was our favorite traditional fine dining meal in Copenhagen. Food and service were flawless. A tour of the test and main kitchens was a nice touch. Not cheap, but Michelin stars seldom are. They earned their's. Did I mention the space is beautiful and perched over the city's soccer field and practice fields?","50"
"dramady","Obviously, for a three Michelin star restaurant, one expects many courses and exquisite flavors and that is true here, as well. After finding our way in (there is a sign outside the stadium to lead to the elevators), we were greeted warmly and made to feel at home. The executive chef was being interviewed for a Japanese publication while we were there, and the assistant head chef was experiencing the food at the table next to us. All the courses were quite unique and good (we had the Winter Dream menu; beetroot made many appearances). Throughout, each course was explained and we met most of the staff this way. Before the dessert course, we were given a tour which was a very nice touch. Even the hubby's tea was an experience.   It took about three hours all told and expect to pay for such an experience, but it was lovely and if you have the means, it is definitely worth it.","50"
"scytong","Fantastic dining experience all around from the booking process to email communications about allergies, changes to the number of diners. The staff are great and helpful, and most importantly, the food is amazing! The dishes had a lot of complexity, but were also beautifully prepared, balanced AND tasted great! I don't usually wax eloquent about desserts, but the dessert courses were to die for!   The restaurant setting is formal, but you don't necessarily have to dress formally. If you only have time enough for a single fine dining experience in Copenhagen, it has to be Geranium!","50"
"trailofcrumbs15","This was our third time at Geranium and our high expectations were exceeded yet again. The food executed with such perfection both in terms of flavour and aesthetic. The tasting menu itself was just a beautiful adventure, which didn’t make us feel sick at the end. The Big and Bold wine pairing was excellent. It’s my favourite restaurant in Copenhagen and one of my favourites in the world. Thank you Geranium team!","50"
"dr_aaltonen","Venue is not very promising outside: football stadium. There is nobody at the front door, and lift does not depart from typical office building in any way. But the restaurant in 8th floor is different in every way. Lounge area has Eames chairs and modern fireplace. In the dining room all furniture is oak. Everything looks very good. Service is professional and relaxed, as always in Danish restaurants, even the best ones.  And the food, it was exceptional! Set menu of 18 dishes including amuse bouche, and every single one of them was superb. It’s impossible to pick the best one since all was the best. Exhaustive wine cellar. Three pairing options, even the most basic was very good.  One of the best in the world, absolutely!","50"
"KennethPages","What a wonderful dinner! Now it is a little weird to go to a stadium for dinner but let's leave it at that because this is a fabulous restaurant we thoroughly enjoyed. Service was knowledgeable, friendly and fun. Food was traditional with a spin. This is not a Michelin restaurant where you struggle to tie together food to presentation. Flavors are intense - to quote Joseph ""How did they get this much flavor in such a small package?!?!?"" Fantastic wine pairings. Open kitchen concept. There are so many options in Copenhagen - make Geranium one of your options!","50"
"lauramS7027TK","My boyfriend and I reserved a table at Geranium for lunch and spent four hours indulging in the best meal I’ve ever eaten. Sixteen courses and an incredible selection of beer and wine to accompany the meal. I don’t know that I’ll ever find a restaurant with better food or service, it was a really special experience.","50"
"sed3839","We celebrated a special birthday at Geranium and could not have been more pleased. It is not just a fancy meal, it is an experience you’ll remember for a lifetime. We were lucky enough to be seated at the chef’s table which allowed for plenty of interaction with the staff.   Chef Rasmus personally presented at least half of the 20+ courses.   I would definitely recommend the wine pairing. We did the classic which was very nice and paired perfectly.   I would note that the menu is very light on meat, but this did not detract from the meal which was creative and delicious nonetheless.","50"
"westy54","The restaurant is uniquely located on the 8th floor of the Parken Stadium, home ground for FC Copenhagen, and a 10 to 15 minute drive from the centre of town. You get a view of the pitch from the prep kitchen and a great view over the surrounding parkland from the restaurant.  We secured a reservation for dinner some months in advance and arrived to find that it was the first day for their Autumn menu. Altogether there were 15 courses, plus bread and 2 sweets with coffee. The 15 courses included 5 appetisers, 6 main dishes and 4 desserts. All of the dishes had a tremendous amount of flavour and texture and were beautifully presented. Cost was DKK2,500 per person for the Autumn Universe menu. Coffee (DKK100 per person) plus drinks were extra.  Service was exquisite with the dishes being well spaced. The making and service of the coffee, which is done at the table, is in itself an art form.  Overall with a tour of the restaurant including the prep kitchen (there also appears to be a third kitchen for the private dining area), wine cellar (we were told that there were over 7,800 bottles of wine from around the world - which explains the extensive wine list), the open plan kitchen in the restaurant and a quick meet and greet with Rasmus, the experience took just over 3 hours. During this time we also got to see the magnificent sunset from our vantage point next to the exceptionally large windows.  We were also told that they employed 37 chefs and had only 7 stagiaires. That is almost one chef per patron.  An excellent evening.","50"
"Explorer21476","My husband and I celebrated our anniversary there while visiting Copenhagen (we are from Seattle area) and couldn’t have been more pleased! Expensive, ok- but for the service, food and art experienced, not really and worth the investment. They bring eating and food to a new level rarely if ever accomplished...","50"
"Bangsgaard_London","We keep on coming back to this one in Copenhagen due to the quality and creativity Rasmus has created at Geranium. The TEAM of chef's keeps on surprising us and it is probably the best menu available if you want to experience an extraordinary dinner on the global scene.","50"
"Guus d","Excellent dining and wining. Service the same! Of you visit Kopenhagen this is the place to go. Do not forget to make a reservation on time!","50"
"annieda","This restaurant is an experience. Not just being in a football stadium quite a walk out of town, but the whole evening was an event. Food of exceptional quality, beautifully served, immaculately presented and just the most amazing flavours. Superlatives all round. But it is expensive so do not expect to be able to go and just have a few courses, its fifteen courses or nothing! And once your there you might as well go for the wine pairing as you will taste wines you would never otherwise have the opportunity to, so go for it! The tour round the restaurant is a lovely touch and an opportunity to talk to a member of staff. Full of passion and a delight all round!","50"
"antonis367081","It was a unique experience in this 3 Michelin stars restaurant. Eventhough the location is alternative, the view from this place is great. The open kitchen gives you the impression that you are part of the game. Impeccable presentation of dishes and unique food taste. We enjoyed our lunch more than anything else in Copenhagen. The head chef Thanos was so attentive and polite to explain everything, from food ingredients and preparation to restaurant's organisation and operation. Well done! Well deserved 3 stars!","50"
"Vegemitelover","Geranium is definitely pricey but in my view the experience was priceless. The overall experience as well as the food is why it has three stars (vs less).   Pluses - flawless dishes. Other than one (mushroom soup) which we found too salty, all the dishes were beautifully presented and definitely sophisticated (especially the mix of textures). The flavours are very subtle - knowledgeable staff. We felt they were very friendly and also had great eq - beautiful venue overlooking a park  Minus - prices - definitely the most expensive tasting menu we have had - although we do need to note that we are in Scandinavia!  Try it out if you are in Copenhagen! ","50"
"malouhede","We had an awesome evening at Geranium - everything was perfect: great food, excellent wine and perfect service. The experience is so much more than just a meal - it is actually art! I can highly recommend it!","50"
"lynnept","Amazing experience with lovely, friendly people. Quiet room at the top of the stadium building (which everyone thinks is an odd choice, but they got the space they needed for the kitchen and a view). Immaculate service which manages to be open and friendly and not at all stuffy or pretentious. Quite high prices, of course, but this is Copenhagen which is typical. 3 Michelin stars. Translates into $400 American dollars/person WITHOUT wine. (clearly once in a lifetime) Food and service were as amazing as they should have been at this price point. If you think of it as theatre and a 4 hour evening well spent (arrived at 6:30 and left at 10:30). Tour of the kitchen is a very nice touch at the end of the evening. Flavors subtle and light for the most part and you will feel well fed, but definitely not overly so. Thank you, Geranium, I will remember the sweet open nature of Copenhagen through my Instagram worthy photos of your beautiful food!","50"
"Cmhopatrick","The 16 courses which I had were very presentable. On average, the taste was good but I didn’t know what I had. Also, I could not remember what I had taken. With 16 dishes offered to clients, I think the chef did not have confidence in his signature dishes. For me, 5 dishes are perfect.  However, I have to say the environment of the restaurant is very nice. The services were brilliant. It was an wonderful experience but I don’t think I will go back.","30"
"839amyl","For 300 euros for tasting lunch (no other choice) , I would expect exceptional experience. However, mine was nothing close to it.   I was worried with 17- course lunch ( thinking will, be too much) but I was left half hungry coz 17 courses actually means 17 spoonful of food as each course is soooo tiny. 3 teaspoons of soup, 3 onion pedals , 2 crispy crunches etc... Each is a course of it's own. They should be called garnishes or side dishes and not a course.   The first course arrived and I was super disappointed. Lobster soup with fermented carrot. First I don't see or taste any lobster, second, the potion is so small I can't each taste the food, third the taste just dont go together.   I dont want to elaborate on the rest of the courses but i do give credit to the amount of preparation and presentation of each dish. They are art pieces. However, im here for food in addition to presentation ( especially if im paying 300 euros ) so this definitely didn't do justice. If they charge 150 euros, I would have no complain, but not for 300.  Plus, out of all 17 dishes, most of the ingredients are ""cheap"", the only meat that was served in the 17-course was chicken. Others we're mushrooms, onions, herbs, and some seafood but the portion was so small i cant even taste the freshness of each dish.  I'm sorry but I have been to many michelin stars restaurants and this is the worst.   ","20"
"BrianLatimer","Let me start by telling you that my wife and I are on a 5 month tour of Europe and the cuisine thereof. We have dined at some of the finest restaurants in the world on this journey (as well as a previous one year European trip we did two years ago) and are no strangers to haute cuisine or the cost associated.  However, in this case I have to make an exception: the cost for a meal at Geranium is not only obscene but unjustifiable by ANY measure. We are not cheapskates nor do we count dollars when experiencing fine dining. But to pay $925.00 for two people (including a $110.00 bottle of wine) is just beyond the pale...no matter what the meal consists of. Did we have Beluga caviar? No. Did we have lobster? No. So exactly what did we have that would justify such an exorbitant cost? Yes, we did have razor clams that, apparently, take four days to make (really?). Look, we've dined at Paul Bucose, Le Bernadine and many, many other three star restaurants that didn't even come close to the cost of Geranium. And I'm still scratching my head, why? The food is outstanding but certainly no better than we've experienced at several other restaurants for far less. Want a few examples? Ciel Bleu in Amsterdam for one. Le Bernadine for another. I could name a half dozen restaurants that were as good or better than Geranium for 25%`30% less cost. As for the service: it was very good (as it should be with a three star status) but no better than I've had at many two star restaurants. I would love to coo and compliment as others have on this site about how this is the best dining experience I've ever had but that would be disingenuous. IF this restaurant cost 25%~30% less than it did would I be exclaiming its virtues over others? Not really. A VERY solid dining experience but certainly no better than some of the finest restaurant we've dined at before. Sorry...but that's my humble opinion.","40"
"Christian3333","I could see a lot of efforts were spent on the presentation unfortunately didn’t translate into taste. The ingredients were not expensive and the portions were way to small to call it a course more like 17 bites. There is no red meat in all the courses which is kind of a waste with such extensive wine list. The only meat dish was chicken which was disappointing since I’m paying almost 300 euro per person for the tasting menu. Service was good and a nice little tour of the kitchen was interesting. I remember may be 3 out of the 17 courses and one of them was dessert. The rest was bland or the ingredients didn’t go together or pointless. For that price definitely expected more.","20"
"Bryan S","Geranium is a truly amazing dining experience. 16 courses plus multiple “little bites”. Each thing executed and presented to perfection. Unbelievable service from an experienced group of professionals who understand and cater to something close to the ultimate “foodie experience”. It could not have been any better. A wonderful experience if you really care about gourmet food and dining.","50"
"Runar N","Yes, it is artistry as much as food, yes it is expensive - but in my view worth it. 4,5 hour lunch is of course not good if you are in a hurry, but if this is your main reason for visiting Copenhagen, it is 4.5 hours of enjoyment. Great food, great service, some nice ""show elements"" in between, nice tour of the premises. Everything was perfect, except for the coffee, which was actually not very good at all - but contrary to other high class restaurants often overcharging for coffee, here it was included. Strongly recommended if you like this kind of food and experiences in stead of going to the teater. We had a great time at the football stadium!","50"
"TravelCapes","We had a fantastic experience at Geranium. Food is interesting and excellent. Service is excellent and personable. The wine list (do the pairing menu!) is fantastic. This is a *** Guide Michelin restaurant where the staff is allowed to have a personality, interact with guests in a very personable way and the experience is brilliant. You are up for a treat!","50"
"NaughtyNomad","I have no words to describe the experience i just had - it was unforgettable! You don't go to Geranium just for the food. The talent here is unbelievable and the taste of everything will stay with you for life. Where do i start with the service? The most passionate, down-to-earth team who take pride in what they do. The chefs from Rasmus and the team are some of the most humble & genuine people i have come across. Even the coffee is a show piece. So worthy of 3 Michelin stars. If in Copenhagen this is a must visit. Some would ask how can you spend that much on a meal? I didnt. I spent money on an experience that will stay with me forever.","50"
"Navi-boy-37","Had an incredible dining experience here with my girlfriend. We were enthralled by all the creative dishes, the flavours, the service, everything was just exquisite. Our wine pairing was to die for, and I fell even more in love with wine during this. Everyone was so kind and knowledgeable, and each dish was so unique. Worth the extra $, its more than a meal, its an experience of the senses and intellect alike.","50"

"KeithR903","I'm not really one for fancy restaurants - my wife is - so this isn't a foodie's review, it's just from an ordinary Joe...   We ate here before jumping on a cruise ship, and had to cut our lunch experience ""short"" - to around 3 hours! - because of this. 17 individual courses, each one tiny but so many actually counting as amazing art rather than food...   The service was very efficient and friendly, the restaurant is bright and airy, the views are very nice, the food interesting and generally tasty; the whole thing is a great experience.  You could never justify the money that it costs if you think of it as a meal, but if you consider it as something like going to the theatre, or having a flying lesson or some other ridiculously expensive but pleasurable experience that leaves you only with memories, then go ahead...","50"

"L8227EYkens","Overlooking the national stadium, the restaurant is an elegant study in white marble and grey couches.   The food is predictably good. Well-cooked, beautifully presented but lacking heart. Everything is very dainty and refined, I appreciated the flavours but didn’t get stuck into any particular dish.   The cheapest wine pairing is an eye watering 1400 kroner. For wine that is just all right. I thought the juice pairing was way more interesting.   Service was a bit stiff. Eg - Waiters floundered when they didn’t have a partner to lift up finished dishes at the same time. There was a very long 30 minute wait for the last savoury course. That was followed by an interesting tour of the kitchen and wine cellar.   A pricey and delicate meal. I can see why this is a Michelin favourite!","40"

"StrategistToronto","Wonderful setting, very ambitious and complicated menu with great service. Five appetizers included crispy leaves, walnut oil and razor clam, 7 main dishes included monk fish with morels and pickled elderflowers and crispy grain along with marbled hake with caviar and for the 3 desserts we were treated with herbs of the forest and tasty berries and ice cream with rhubarb and honey. We saw all of the goings on in the kitchen and a fabulous demonstration of taking the glass top off a port bottle using heat and water as the corks on these old bottles can be rotten. All in all a great way to spend an afternoon with fabulous food, wines and juice pairings in a lovely setting with great services. One of the best in our gastronomic trip!","50"
"Whitsiepoo","Geranium is by far the most eclectic and wonderful restaurant in which I’ve ever “lunched.” It’s a multi-course, “gourmet” meal with lots and lots of strange dishes, most of which I can never remember. They were all served on exquisite dinnerware by “true culinary artists.” I’m always worried, when I lunch in one of these places, if I’ll be able to eat everything set before me on the table, but I was, and I enjoyed all the really very special courses. I would recommend it to any gourmets enjoying a trip to Copenhagen and with lots of time (and cash) to enjoy something completely out of the ordinary!","50"
"Julsgp","What a great restaurant to go to. Make sure you make reservations in advance but take the wine pairing. I promise you there is no regrets!  Was greeted and felt welcome even though i was alone, it didnt feel lonely as everyone was there to chat with you and make you feel comfortable! This restaurant truly lived up to their 3 star Michelin standard with fresh and beautiful produce and amazing taste!  Was then taken a tour around the kitchen and everything looks so new and clean!  Its one restaurant i will definitely return again to dine!","50"

"HampshireNat","We were here for our wedding anniversary and they took every opportunity to make this special for us. We had the owener of the business look after us during the evening which was lovely. The menu is a tasting affair with either a juice or wine paring. Its all insanley expensive but heh ho, its a special occasion. The various courses are served by the chefs and each dish explained. What is really ncie is that everyone is prepared to engage in conversation. The wine is regulalry topped up throughout the evening and water is readily available. During the red wine paring we were approached by Soren, a table complete with blow torch, a pair of medievil tongs and a bottle of wine! Look at their web site to see what happens.. Great spectale. They also brought us another bottle and talked us through it only for us to spot that it was from our wedding year. Very nice touch. A tour through the wine cellar and kitchens followed together with a picture with all the chefs. As for the location, we liked it. The fact it was high up gave great views and once you are in there, you could be anywhere. Staff were all outstanding. Soren and Rasmus were wonderful and the food was stunning. The cost...? Well although it was th emost I have ever paid for 2 meals ever, I ask myself would I pay £150, £200, £250 per ticket for a concert or a play at a theatre? Well yes I have. Well here you got the theatre, the production AND a 3 star meal. We arrived at 7.15 and left just before midnight. No concert or play lasts that long.. Thank you all.","50"
"Pablo9522","Without doubt a 5 star experience whether we are talking about the food, the service or the dining room.

We even had a tour of the wine cellars and kitchens followed by a group picture with all the staff 3.5 hours flew past and the experience was everything you would want.  ","50"

"GC1979","Geranium has been on our list for a very long time, but I'm glad we've waited until now to go. I never had the pleasure of eating here when it held 1 or 2 stars, but whatever has happened in Rasmus and Sven's journey, the entire experience (and it was an experience) at Geranium feels like this is a restaurant that has found its place and knows how to do what it does exceptionally well.  Unlike other reviews, I don't feel the need to highlight any particular dish (all 18+ are amazing) but instead I would simply urge you to indulge yourself. Not only is it worth every Kroner, but having got to know all of the staff from the moment they craft a spherical ice cube for a pre-dinner drink, through the incredible choreography that it takes to serve 18 courses, to the tour of the restaurant and photos with the cooking team (including photo bombs), to the most elaborate way I've ever seen someone extract wine from a bottle, you'll walk away smiling and with memories that will last for a long time. All of this, of course, with the elegance, warmth and hygge that you'd expect from a Danish restaurant at the top of its game. Simply stunning.","50"
"geoblis","  You will be intrigued by the low vote, well bear with me and you will understand.   Firstly, this restaurant belongs to the very expensive category, hence, there are no excuses whatsoever.   The food is spectacularly beautiful, and each dish is graciously presented by the chef’s who made it. The show is well oiled. The service was perfect, but can it really be different?  My problem is that the reason I go to a restaurant is to eat. Hence, what I enjoy most is the taste. This is the part that for me was really disappointing. It is a bit like buying a beautiful coat that does not keep you warm. We were three at the table and the feeling was mutual.  We had 16 courses and we like only 2 : the cannolicchio and the mussel were delicious. The rest did not convince me at all.  So no I would not recommend this restaurant because I believe there are much better places.   But If you like a good and rather expensive show, then Geranium is for you.","20"

"Klaus H","Geranium. Quite possibly the best Denmark has to offer when it comes to fine dining if you are to trust the Michelin guide and the word of the town. Felt lucky to get a reservation there at the last opening night before Christmas. Went there with sky high expectations that had been building up for months. Expectations worthy of a top rated Michelin restaurant.   Location. It seems a bit strange that a high end restaurant like Geranium is located at a football stadium, quite far away from the Copenhagen city centre. To get here, you need to take a taxi, the bus or drive on your own. The entrance is tugged away behind the building.   Interior design. The entrance it self does not seem like much. It looks like the entrance of an average office building, with a bronze cow with no head located in the lobby - a rather strange installation. After going to the 8th floor however, the impression changes. A warm welcome awaits, in nicely designed, nicely decorated facilities. It is clear, that everything has been thought about and nothing left to chance. Exactly this leaves me wonder about the height of the tables. They are all incredibly low. Initially it made our party wonder, if this was a design feature made to impose a specific posture with the guests, sitting up tall and straight at the tables. After asking the staff questions related to the height of the tables, with no obvious conclusion, it was clear that the very low tables had no apparent function. It is simply an annoying feature.   Food. We got the Winter menu with vine paring. The menu kicks of at an extremely high level! Beautiful appetisers followed by various main courses. Vine and food is perfectly matched, challenging the senses as you would expect from a restaurant of this calliper. All goes really well until about half way into the mains. Up until this point everything regarding the menu and vine paring is pure perfection. But then something happens... A Sonate No. 9 Opus 10 Champagne was served and there is nothing good to say about this Champagne; it was extremely heavy on yeast and smelled horribly fermented - everyone at our table agreed that it tasted like cheap Chinese rice vine. It was flat out horrible. The kale dish served at this point was flat and tasteless. After the Champagne the first red vine of the evening was served. A powerful Spanish Priorat that was served slightly young to my taste. It had a beautiful bouquet, but did not perform on other accounts. A slightly underwhelming experience. Along with the red, a venison dish were served. It was tasteful, but nothing spectacular. I had a strange feeling that something was missing?  After the venison we were all surprised to realise, that we had come to the end of the mains. It feels like a very sudden stop after a few very small mains and only one red vine. We all felt that something was missing - a strange amputated feeling.   After the mains we went on the obligatory tour of the vine “cellar” and the kitchens. This is a classy touch!  Deserts were good, but not spectacular. A few of the sweets did not taste well.   The wine package is rather pricy at 1.400 DKK considering the number, amount and quality of vine. The glasses were nearly empty, and rarely refilled. We even had to ask for refills occasionally. I am very disappointed in the fact that only one average level red vine were served this evening, especially considering the fact, that the menu is titled “Winter Universe”. I would have expected more heavy reds in stead of the menu consisting mainly of light whites and sparkling vines.   Service. Staff is friendly and attentive. Can’t really explain why, but despite the seemingly good service, I have a strange feeling that something is missing... maybe due to the very small vine servings? Maybe because of the time it took for them to clean the table... I don’t know, and can’t explain the feeling any better.   Conclusion. The first half of the menu was perfect. Nothing less. Last part of the mains did not work, and the Champagne completely ruined the scallop dish. Deserts were average - nothing spectacular. In general the entire menu seemed unfinished, and the amount of food is small. The vine paring is severely overpriced, and only very small amounts of vine is served. We ended up paying more than 15.000 DKK for the evening for a party of 4. Thats simply too expensive!   Honestly, I do not understand what the fuzz is about... I have been to several restaurants, even with no Michelin stars, that were significantly better at less than half the price. All in all a disappointment.","20"

"Leslie C","Our table was smack in front of the huge open kitchen which never once emitted so much as a hint of smoke or anything cooking for that matter. Geranium, which got its 3rd Michelin star in 2016, holds this record while Noma, originally billed as the ""world's finest restaurant"" and which has 2 Michelin stars, remains closed pending a re-opening in a new Copenhagen location. Not surprisingly, the founders of Geranium originally came from Noma. It was dark when we arrived for dinner in mid-December at the restaurant which is on the 8th floor of a modern building looming over FC Copenhagen stadium. On a clear day at lunch there is a great view over a park and in the distance, the Sound and Sweden. Manos Feskos, Assistant Chief Chef who hails from Greece, introduced himself to us. Many of the staff, as in other new Nordic cuisine restaurants, come from elsewhere in Europe and the States. For the first few minutes we were fascinated to watch the chefs and their assistants preparing the varied dishes. The routine was nothing short of a choreographed dance. An intent young woman used a pair of tweezers to put the finishing touches on her creation. My wife dubbed this work a ""menu under the microscope.""  Staccato commands issued from the chefs and sous chefs which reminded us of the preparations for a space launch. The appetizers were beautiful to look at but were not the highlight. The caviar and shaved truffles on the other hand were exquisite.The salted hake, creamy trout and scallops in juniper emphasized the Nordic origins of the place. Geranium is duly famous for its vegetable creations which are hard to beat but the vension too was tops. The restaurant has an exceptional wine list with bottles listed in the ""World's Best Wine"" of 2017. Søren Ledet, a co-owner is the sommelier and reigns over the 8,000 plus bottles he showed us in the wine cellar after we had dinner.  A deposit must be paid of DKK 750 (about 100 Euros) before a reservation can be confirmed. Geranium is open four days a week.","40"
"711lineb","Geranium still is the most outstanding dinner experience I have ever had. Every bite of the food is fantastic, and almost overwhelming in perfection. But it is not just a meal, it is a dance, a perfectly choreographed teamwork between the chefs, the waiters and the food. Pay attention to how everything is perfectly timed, and yet everybody is friendly and relaxed. On top of it all, they knew that we had been there before, and greeted us welcome back - perhaps an easy trick, but stil nice :)","50"

"MARIO77593","I can only say thank you firstable to Mr. Rasmus for the dedication and passion I ve seen from him, and I mean he was part of the service , not like other top chefs I ve seen , his concentration to every dish is second to none. He sends messages to other chefs quietly with very few words and every other chef reacts immediately. The fact that the kitchen is part of the dining room or the other way around works incredible well that is also thanks to Mr Soren. I should say is the other face of Geranium. He does make sure every table is living this great experience. I have to say all the chefs they were so kind with me I felt like a kid in toy shop when they applaud me in the kitchen , also big thanks , I think Sous chef I can not remember his name but I know he is from Sidney Thank YOU!! Now I can talk about the food, I am a private cook myself so I think I can have an opinion as a chef as I am very passionate in my 40s but have not stop yet of learning and improving myself, also I have eating in a few 3, 2, one and top restaurants with no stars. Every dish was fantastic , technically and not only that , they were very tasty and beautiful. You might think is normal for a 3 star but I can assure you that is not always the case. I think I will not mention the dishes, even though I could go one by one, But I do have I don't know if it is a problem but that dish of the dill stones and the tree brunches I can not get them out of my my mind, I know other chefs like Andoni recreates a lot of nature and psychologically is also fantastic {fossil, stones, veg. charcoal} but they miss something I think very important. Deliciussness !!! And in my oppinium Geranium is got it.  Ok I write this few lines at almost 4 o'clock in the morning after a few beers and more dedicated to Geranium team. Last thing I have to say thank you to the waitress it was looking after my table, I am sorry I am terrible with names, {Specially when I find someone interesting} also don't know if correct to write it , she was from the U.S.A . I hope I was not too difficult, you were incredible attentive, just one example when the venison dish came I had the beetrrot and something else jus [was nice} but after tasting I was craving for a red, you saw it immediately, also thanks for your recommendation on the cocktail bar . Even though I could not invite you for a dink.:} !! Anyway Anyway I love you all Geranium for making me more crazy ! and as I said \ BIG THAKS Mario","50"

In the 21st century, Denmark is one of the richest countries in the world, ranked #1 for happiness, and Copenhagen is the home of several world famous restaurants including Geranium.   Situated on the 8th floor of the FC Copenhagen Stadium, this Michelin 3-star restaurant is ranked #19 in the World Top 50 Best Restaurants list.

"TheSmegHeadDuck","We went to Geranium on Saturday with 2 friends to celebrate my wife's birthday.   The staff are great, friendly and engaging. The wine list is exceptional. And the environment is the personification of a modern restaurant. So why the 3 stars??  Well the main issue is the food quality price ratio. The menu was 2000 DKK plus 1500 for the wine pairing which we shared (one for each couple). The food was so so, nothing which took our breath away, too many sweets at the end and no cheese!! OMG!  The main issue was the food was too complex like they were trying too hard to be clever with the combinations.  We felt that we didn't get great value from the experience and wouldn't go there again.  After eating at Amass, Kin Kin and Geranium I would recommend a visit to Amass. They are much better value and you really experience a different style of cuisine. We felt like we were on a high after eating in Amass. Kin Kin would be my second choice with Geranium last...

"diplomaticablog","If you are interested in food and in trying new flavours you should go to this restaurant, which is a flagship of the new Nordic cooking. The ingredients are seasonal and local. What is on your plate is a very sophisticated combination of flavours, texture, colours and shapes, which is a reminder of the freshness of this region. The style of the restaurant is minimalist and simple. It is an open space with 12 tables including the kitchen (you can see your food being prepared). The staff are young, international and multilingual. It is expensive, which is not surprising being a 3-Michelin-star, but stands out compared to other restaurants of the same level thanks to its Nordic, unpretentious style.","50"
"banyuls034","Some dishes are just fabulous, taste, inspiration, originality, so well balanced, tasty and wonderful texture: salted hake, creamy trout, scallop in juniper aromas. Some are not at the same levels: the first snacks, roasted onions, and mainly venison. Desserts are very good. The team seems very friendly... when together. But not with a lonely man passionated by food and wines. They just recites what they learned by heart, except maybe 2 people out of more than 12 different that come to you... Trip in the kitchen is fun. The very bad point is wine and sommelier: pretentious, never ask any question; I had some wines not that interesting, not always at good temperature. The famous brands are OK (Paillard, Release, Haisma, Vin de Constance...), the original ones not good for the price, mainly vinho verde and PIUUS. But mainly this man did something that I have never seen and I find that totally crazy, not needed at all and very dangerous for health: he broke down a bottle with a chock with temperature just below the cork !!! What for? If the wine is corky, it remains...! And even after filtering, you might have some glass in your stomach: very good... mainly for cancer... Nevertheless, a place nice to go if you love unique and creative food with amazing balance and texture, and have money for it.","30"

"Marius L","Our yearly road-trip with the wine-and-dine club went to Copenhagen. Friday night, we got really lucky and had the chef's table reserved. This is not just a separate table, it is a separate room, and like the welcoming waiter said; please make yourself comfortable and do as you like, jump on the table and rip off your shirts :) - we didn't but boy how we enjoyed this place. Indeed, the restaurant is in a football stadium but that is soon forgotten once you get into this well lit, modern restaurant. I'll not go into details about the courses itself as they vary greatly with season - but this is strictly Nordic. All dishes are technically advanced, elegant subtle tastes. It is just impressing when you get the tour of the kitchen to see how controlled, streamlined and professional this is. Not much noise in the kitchen at all, and at the assembly table which we sat next to, you almost won't notice they are there. It is professionalism to the bone. The somellier was just insanely knowledgeable and gave us in-depth stories behind every wine. And we also got a tour in the wine-room where the contents were just amazing.  As the night came to an end, the somellier humbly excused himself and said that he had to leave us, because he had to spend the night in the wine-room to get throght the wine logistics before monday. We certainly didn't envy that.  All in all, an amazing dinner from a-z. If i was to pick on something, i'd wish for a tad more punch in the tastes. I know this is strictly nordic but i think that would leave no doubt for a 6 on the dice. This time I'm at 5.5 in total :)","50"
"skovmeister","My fiance and I had the pleasure of visiting Restaurant Geranium, one of the 3* Michelin restaurants  With a brand new autumn univers menu, this was a truely journey in taste, sences, food and wine and not to forget the service by the waitresses and sommerlier  I won’t tell in detail about all what we got but it ranged and contained it all, incredibly created, vegetables, fish, meat, truffle and caviar, appetizers, different courses in a stream, salty and sweet, coffee and at last avec to finish  This has been the most amazing experience we have ever tried, everything to perfection, even though it is a bit expensive this is a must try for gourmet’s and foodies, I can only give it my very best recommendations and hope you feel as good as we did","50"
"Akiko O","It was an ok experience overall. Probably the interior and architecture of the restaurant were my favorite above all about Geranium. It’s minimal but stylish and comfortable. And it’s gorgeously light because of the floor to sealing windows.  Food was beautiful and interesting. I was not impressed by appetizers, but some of courses tasted wonderful. I enjoyed their vegetables more than shellfish and meat. My partner who did vegetarian tasting menu, he was absolutely in heaven for every single course. So, they might be simply stronger in vegetables.  Service they were trying to provide was good, actually great, especially there were some entertaining services by the table. Also apprentices in the kitchen come serve a few courses, which was a nice touch.  But we were probably unlucky that our main server was a grumpy, untrained one. I tried to think she was just casual, but I had to conclude that she was not happy about being a server.  For a course, I asked her if sesame oil was used in it. She said “I don’t know! Chef uses many different oils.” Well, it would have been nice if she said she would check with the kitchen if she didn’t know what she was serving.   At the end of the meal, she brought us a sheet of paper, saying it’s the list of drinks that were served for pairing. But the list seemed wrong. So, I politely asked her if we really had had those wines on the list. She was not happy to be questioned and just said “no!” and took it back without “oops” or “sorry” and brought me the correct list, just saying “here!”.   I can’t believe Geranium had such a problematic server who can ruin an entire experience.","30"
"Eddie B","Geranium is more than a restaurant - it’s an experience. As a solo traveler and one that normally doesn’t visit Michelin starred restaurants, I was nervous at first on what to expect. That sense was quickly overcome by the kindness of the staff, the variety of dishes, and the overall experience. This not a stuffy restaurant. The staff is so down-to-earth and extremely passionate about food. For solo travelers, you can tell they’re used to them and make sure that you’re comfortable and happy. There’s not a lot of lag time between dishes so you don’t get bored. About the food.....amazing and creative! You experience flavors you’ve never eaten before and interesting combinations that you know required a lot of testing! You’re eating well-tested dishes that portray a theater of foods, to say. The experience is 3 or so hours and also includes a tour of the kitchen by a member of the chef’s team, and for me, included a group picture with all of the chefs. In the end, the restaurant provides you a menu of everything you ate and drank which includes a stamp of the day you went there. I’ll always remember this dinner. While pricey, I truly feel that you are getting so much for your money. A dinner at Geranium is a once in a lifetime experience, and one where the memories last forever.","50"

Food...so imaginative and delicious that it's hard to describe. If you are a meat and three person...don't go. Each course is a delight for all of your senses. Beautiful to see, smell and taste. The servers are very professional and explain every dish.   Service. Right from the start when they bring stools for handbags, the service is perfection. As the dishes are served at just the right pace, the next arrives. An explanation of the dish with ingredients is just right.   Location. The restaurant is located in the building that serves as Copenhagen's soccer team. It is on the top floor with a great view of the park.   It is expensive but as my British friends say ""value for money"".","50"
"410DavidL","This is not your stereotypical, stuffy three-star Michelin restaurant. The 17-course dinner will delight, and the precision of the plating and table service is flawless. It is terrific that Geranium offers a juice pairing in addition to a great wine pairing.   What's special is how much you will enjoy the dining experience. The chefs and serving staff do a splendid job of explaining each course (and preparing some at table side), but in a sincere and cordial way with no hint of superiority or condescension. Diners are most likely here for the first time, and you will depart wishing you could return again soon. The maitre d' even had some fun with us when we asked to have a photo taken. He photobombed us!   The summer menu is all seafood, save one chicken course and ham fat used to flavor one dish. When first seated, the server asked about allergies, and that was handled smoothly and effortlessly.   The most fascinating course (for flavor) was the tomato water with ham fat. The most aromatic course was the langoustine scented with juniper needles that are burned at the table.   Of course, the behind-the-scenes visit before dessert is another highlight for foodies. We met a young ""intern"" from the U.S. who grew up near my home town. Geranium has exacting standards and high expectations of its chefs and serving staff, and the execution is perfect.   The restaurant's location is somewhat unusual, being eight stories above the National Football Stadium and a beautiful park. The wall of windows frames the park. You don't see the stadium until you go to the kitchen where chefs can take in any match or concert underway below them.   The restaurant thoughtfully emailed us a day ahead to advise us of certain road blocks due to a major concert being set up in the stadium. They were also helpful in ordering a taxi afterwards, even accompanying us in the elevator and walking us out to the taxi.  The only flaw, and it's minor, was the location of our table with banquette seating for both diners. Staff bumped into the banquette several times, apologizing of course, to access a service area. Still, a bump could lead to spilled drinks.   Despite that, don't miss Geranium if you want a spectacular dining experience in Copenhagen. And bring your camera. They don't mind, and many people were taking non-flash photos. It's all part of a celebration of exceptional food and beverage.","50"
"d-dobbeltV","Amazing food - Amazing wine - Amazing Service. Normally I am a fan of a noisy kitchen with sound of pots and pans making sounds. But the clinical perfection on Geranium is mesmerizing and it seems like a laboratory in its perfection. I did not have a single dish where there was an element that I thought I could make myself. A great experience. Thank you!!!","50"
"TexasJane09","This was not just a meal but an experience. It was our first experience of this kind (a multi-course meal with no menu) and it was almost perfect. We arrived in Copenhagen that morning and had lunch reservations at Geranium. The view from the dining area is restful even if the restaurant is located in a soccer stadium. You do not see the stadium from the restaurant but instead view a park like area with many trees. We were served a 17 course meal, plus an extra desert to celebrate our anniversary. We loved almost every course. They made accommodations for my shrimp allergy. Prior to our last course, we were given a ""behind the scenes"" tour of the restaurant. The entire experience took approximately three hours but at no time did we feel that we were rushed. We did not select either their wine or juice options, but, instead, enjoyed their semi-low alcohol sparkling wine, which was light and pleasant and not sweet at all. Almost everyone was extremely helpful and they arranged for a taxi for us at the conclusion of our meal, even though a soccer game was scheduled for that evening and many fans were already arriving at the stadium. So why only almost perfect....one staff member's overt reaction to the gratuity. As noted by others, this is an expensive experience, approximately $350 per person, without wine or juice option. Note that they do charge for the semi-low alcoholic sparking wine. It was the perfect beginning of our trip to Copenhaven.","50"
"Puja S","This place is phenomenal. From the exquisitely prepared dishes to the professional, down-to-earth service, we were wowed. We brought our 9 month old with us and the restaurant very graciously accommodated us. I've been to many Michelin restaurants but this is by far my favorite.","50"
"MaffieAustralia","We have been to many top restaurants around the world and this one is certainly one of the best experiences ever.

"Ysblack","Location: the restaurant is located on the 8th floor with fantastic view. Unfortunately our table was next to the fireplace with high chairs but lack of back support. Difficult to hold any comfortable posture during 4 hours of dining.  Service: this is the part that kills the 3 stars experience. The female staff is young & funny, exactly what you would expect in a pub but not in a place like Geranium. For me one of them was simply annoying for constantly sharing her opinion about the dishes and wine paring selection in the most arrogant way.   Food: The experience starts in a very high level of culinary execution and keeps the taste buds entertained throughout the service. Some of the dishes didn't match my expectation but you can clearly feel the hard work and perfect attention to details that the kitchen plates out.  Tip: don't come here hungry, portions are tiny and you will leave the table hungry if you don't eat enough bread.  ","30"
"dannaasf","I had the pleasure to dine in geranium in early August 2017 and it was just nothing but superb. From the decor to the service, food to wine selection. It is one of the best restaurant I have ever dined in!  It's on my best restaurant so far: next to Eleven Madison park, Narisawa, Arzak, Ladoyen, the chef table at Brooklyn fare, and many more. Thank you Geranium for your warm hospitality and amazing food!","50"

So many petit courses and the techniques and skills displayed in the presentation and cuisine are quite brilliant. Of course the flavours are intriguing and delicious and very much 'I want more'.

"Joyce K","loved it. We booked the private dining and the experience is unforgettable. 4 personal chefs, a sommelier, and a host and a server all to our party. They are so friendly. The food looked too good to eat. Delicious for sure. They gave us a tour of the wine cellar, curing fridge, prep room and to take a look at their main dining area.  Some think this place pricy, but when compared to the cost of food at regular restaurants, I consider this place very reasonable.   Their service and hospitality spoiled me and made me want to be there every day.  PS. if you go, you must have someone in the party do the ""fruit tasting"" loved it!!!!","50"
"MadamJosephine","I'm not sure if Linda K who gave a bad review on TA was in the same restaurant as us?? Geranium prepares a gastronomic Danish tour of vegetables, herbs, fish and shellfish and on our visit, a chicken course as well, which were all amazing. After the first 6 appetizers I would happily have gone home, but then 6 main courses + bread progressively arrived. All of these dishes showed incredible technique and were completely delicious. Before desserts, we were shown the impressive wine cellar, kitchens and the private dining area. Three desserts followed, all showing a lightness of touch and were not too sweet. With excellent filtered coffee, 5 little petit fours were the perfect way to finish. Whilst in an odd location on top of a football stadium, the room is stylishly Scandinavian with lovely views of greenery. The service is perfection from an International team who are obviously very well trained. The first 6 Appetizers were not tiny little dishes, but flavour bombs of real substance, that set the standard for the rest of the meal. Yes it's not in-expensive, but it was great value considering the expertise of the chefs and the professionalism of the staff. I would return in a heartbeat.","50"
"Linda K","This place is georgeous, and so are the courses. We went after a business meeting, after some difficulty booking it, and my business partner paid around 2000 euros for 4 people. we had 15 tiny dishes and wine. The wine was good, huge dissapointment and we all agreed. The chef is clearly an artist, but the taste was waaaay, waaay below our expectations. The soup was so bad that non of us could it it, and the portion was no more than 10 spoonfuls. The waitor did not even ask why we had not touched the soup! Unattentive staff to say the least. The seeweed was disgusting. The fish was very good, but it was basically the only thing that was tasty and not enough to get anyone full. I like eating at michelin restaurants, and we wanted to impress our clients, but nobody was impressed and we fet ashamed that we took the to such a dissapointing place. I have heard good things about Geranium, so it was really sad. Coffee was good, place clean and beautiful, the only reason for me not govong it 1 star. The staff was in class of a downtown grill, really, really bad. We went out hungry and ordered room service at the hotel when we got back. Thats bad! So, no, I will not return, ever.","20"
"MrMrsChevalier","well tasting must be understanding .... well at least trying to... This place rocks in every category. The service was impeccable we loved the melange of nationalities. the food was out of this world - a play on textures, colours, temperatures a total senses overload. We were given a tour of the restaurant which even upped the experience even higher ... and to top it all off we relaxed with a coffee, outrageously good coffee I have to add!, as we took in the view of the area and the park. We were lucky to be there on a football match day so we could see the local stars arriving at the stadium...","50"
"Sandy P","Best restaurant I've ever been to and we always choose Michelin restaurants.

If you go you will not be disappointed.","50"
"Italylover50","Geranium was recommended to us by good friends who went last year. They said we were in for the experience of our lives and they were right.  Words cannot do justice to the exceptional quality of the food and the service of the staff. Truly a once in a lifetime experience.","50"
"T4063UCandyk","Our lunch at Geranium was almost faultless. We swapped a rainy Scotland for a rainy Copenhagen. Our trip for lunch, however, was exceptional. We visited Geranium about 3 years ago and loved it then. It was even better this time. The level of the food is outstanding and the service is to match. The only hiccup was that we skipped a course - the razorclam - and had to draw this to the attention of staff. Such was the quality of the whole experience, however, that this barely mattered. Every course was a delight and it is difficult to identify highlights as each course seemed to surpass the last!","50"

"endoedibles","Currently holding position #19 among San Pellegrino’s “The World’s 50 Best Restaurants,” the only Michelin 3* in Copenhagen even during the era of noma and recently ranked as the top Restaurant in The Nordics by The White Guide it is accurate to say that Geranium reigns high over the rest of region’s culinary elite, a location on the eighth floor of Denmark’s national soccer stadium overlooking the Fælledparken making this both a literal and figurative statement.  Toqued by Rasmus Kofoed, his collection of bronze, silver and gold statues from the Bocuse d’Or standing guard over a small lounge, it was just past noon on Wednesday that a brief walk was made from Østerport Station to the back corner of Telia Parken, only a stylized sign indicating the location of a restaurant accessed by elevator, the doors opening directly on the hostess desk where reservations are confirmed with diners soon face-to-face with an airy space looking lengthwise on a gorgeous dining room and exhibition kitchen.  Considered by many to be the next step in Scandinavian Cuisine, Kofoed’s cooking taking ideas of The New Nordic Kitchen Manifesto and presenting them in all their glory with the sort of plating featured at luxe Hotel D’Angleterre rather than the humble stylings of his noma contemporaries, diners visiting Geranium in its current home will immediately be struck by a glorious expanse focused on both nature and a restaurant working silently despite perpetual motion, the mood cheerful yet professional throughout 20+ plates currently highlighting the “Summer Universe.”  Turning fellow-Chef Søren Ledet into Dining Room Manager and Sommelier shortly after opening, Mr. Ledet presenting each guest with a glass of bubbles upon seating, it was mere moments later that the first of several Chefs arrived tableside with a bowl described by a list of its ingredients, the cloudy broth of Carrot Juice sweetened by Sea Buckthorn and fortified by Whey acting as a delicate perfume to the Lobster Custard beneath it.  Not differentiating Amuses or Canapes from actual ‘courses,’ the parade of flavors coming from the kitchen with flawless pacing over the course of three hours, it was following three “leaves” fashioned from Sunchoke that Kofoed’s signature dish of Razor Clam and Sour Cream in an edible shell left nearly everyone in the room smiling, a follow-up of clarified Tomato Water with a float of Ham Fat faintly reminiscent of Stuffed Cabbage after the addition of a spoonful of Herbs and Flower Petals.   Declining Wine or Juice Pairings, though descriptions from the tables surrounding made each sound quite impressive with the later particularly unique compared to what is available elsewhere in the capitol, dish five would unfortunately offer the meal’s lone slip-up by way of “Dill Stones” served with a Sauce of Horseradish and Cucumber Granita, the flavors far too aggressive to be washed away with water alone and thus not only unpleasant on their own, but enough to taint the palate for both the Nettle and Beet dishes to follow.   Thankful for the Yogurt liquids that just so happened to be part of a dish described as a “bonus course,” the acid finally liberating both tongue and sinuses from Dill and heat, it was not a minute too soon as Grilled Asparagus and Trout as well as the disc of Salted Hake bound by Ash were two of the meal’s standouts, the former an aromatic composition with a bright herbal flavors and a touch of umami while the follow-up turned 180° with a velvety texture and iodine finding its foil in tangy Buttermilk and Parsley.   At this point offering Bread Service, a pair of Wheat Crackers alongside addictive two-bite Ancient Grain Loaves and moist Gluten Free Muffins topped with Seeds that paired great with Housemade Butter fortified in Buttermilk and Sorrel, dish ten was being presented for the first time in the dining room that day and although the tableside torching in Juniper seemed mostly for show the flavor of Langoustine presented in Danish Apple Broth with Browned Butter was absolutely beautiful, the sweetness more restrained than one might guess and an elegant lead-in to roasted Turbot topped with a ‘skin’ of Mousseline served in a Sauce of pickled Pine and roasted Bones.  A tasting menu in the truest sense of the word, each dish continuing a theme and often leaving diners wanting a bite more despite fully expressing the Chef’s intentions, dish fourteen featured a dazzling Tartlet topped in crispy Shrimp with herbs and Elderflower, the afternoon’s final savory a dish of confit Chicken and pickled Eggs served beneath a blanket of Mushrooms, Peas and Cruciferous Vegetables.  At this point led on a tour of the restaurant, everything from the wine room to the offices and Kofoed’s Test Kitchen all put on full display, it was shortly after a return to the table that the Summer Universe transitioned to sweets, a crispy Beetroot shell housing Black Currant, Yogurt and Marigold assertive and balanced before the back-and-forth sampling of lightly sweetened Ice Cream and compressed Rhubarb in its own Juices, the small Cake in a pool of Caramel with Green Strawberries and an icy disc a bit less flavorful than one may have hoped, but quickly erased from memory by a Salty Licorice Skull titled “This is the End.”  At this point requesting the bill, though it was clearly foolish to assume that the “end” really meant Chef Rasmus and his team were all out of tricks, it was as the kitchen was starting to wipe down that six more bites were presented, the Pumpkin Tree and Cake each fairly forgettable compared to the rest while a “Green Egg” and Caramel in an edible sheet of Plum both continued the theme of bright herbs and complex textures until the very *end.*","50"

The presentation and micro detail of each dish is beyond imagination but what amazed us was that the tastes that followed stood up to if not exceeded what you saw with your eyes. What makes Geranium and Danish fine dining so refreshing though is that it is served with candid relaxed care. In New York the experience would have been ruined by pretentious hosts and servers that made you feel perhaps unworthy. Not here. Each dish was brought by a chef with a smile and sometime a laugh and time for short discussion if you cared to engage. I commented on this fact with one of the servers and her perfect ironic response was ""its just food - we can't take it too seriously"". In short, worth every penny to flow through this wonderful experience. I will remember it forever.","50"
"James B","I planned a quick jaunt to Copenhagen for Easter weekend. I did it only knowing that I wanted to visit Kronborg Castle and anything else would be icing on the cake. Little did I know, I would be eating at a restaurant as fine as Geranium. I dined by myself(which can be pretty boring). The staff was very personable and killed any of the monotony that can be solo dining. I absolutely loved getting the menu in a sealed envelope it was a nice touch. The food was amazing; from presentation to consumption, absolutely delightful. The wine pairing was second to none. When I left, all I wanted to do was book another reservation with friends.","50"

"Fuzzball79","We went for Saturday lunch as a table of 4 as a family celebration. What was different about this 3 star meal experience above others we've had before was that this time we took our 8 month old daughter.   I imagine most 3stars wouldn't accommodate a baby for fear of the impact on other diners. Geranium from first booking couldn't have been more welcoming. The service we received from the whole Geranium staff was incredible. Genuine, warm, welcoming and in no way stuffy. The French and Americans could learn so much.  The food was beautiful, natural, precise, and peppered with some dishes that were up with the best I've ever tasted. Simplicity on plates this delicious is the Scandinavian way but Geranium takes it to another level.   You can read about the food in other reviews I'm sure but what elevated the Geranium experience above all others were how the front of house manager, his team, and sommelier (the wines fitted our budget perfectly) went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic lunch.   If only we had more family celebrations and were able to go to Geranium for every one.   ","50"
"NYCflyer103","First, a few important points. This restaurant rightly deserves its three Michelin stars and its place among the World's Top 20 Best Restaurants. It is for diners in search of seriously good, complex, intelligently crafted but deeply satisfying food.   My partner and I dined there on May 18, 2017 to celebrate his milestone birthday. The staff at Geranium prepared for us a wonderful and unforgettable feast. They offered us a window-side table with a view of the treetops of Copenhagen's Fælledparken district. Lunch was a procession of very delicious and interesting dishes with wonderfully selected wines by Søren Ledet, Geranium's beverage director. We experienced warm and friendly service. The passion and creativity of Chef Rasmus Kofoed's cuisine shone through on each course. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.   Dining at Geranium was one of the best experiences that we've ever had at a fine-dining restaurant anywhere in the world. We appreciate how their servers take pride in what they serve us by presenting interesting information on what we're eating. They answer questions and welcome the interaction with clients. We love it even more when their sommeliers offer us technical information about the wines we're drinking since we consider ourselves ""wine geeks.""   At the dessert portion of our meal, Chef Rasmus surprised my partner with some birthday cake and a very generous autographed book as a gift. He and Søren even posed with us for a souvenir birthday photo along with the entire kitchen staff. It was a birthday celebration to remember.   Thank you Chef Rasmus, Søren, and the Geranium team for a wonderful experience. We will never forget your kindness. We will be happy to come back on our next visit to Copenhagen. We are also happy to recommend your establishment to our family, colleagues, and friends.","50"
"emami_daniel","Simply astonishing from start to finish - the service, the atmosphere, the food and wine pairing. I could write a much longer review, but there is only one way to sum it up:   This is an experience you will remember for the rest of your life. Truly one of the great restaurants of the world right now.   Expect a bill of around 7K Dkr for 2 people, including champagne, food and wine pairings.","50"
"Bruce P","After trying to book dinner here for months, we were able to enjoy lunch here. With the highest of expectations, this experience exceeded them in every way. The service staff was exceptional and Oh, the food. The tasting menu was brilliant, thoughtful, beautiful, and amazingly delicious. If you have a chance to go here, it is an absolute must for all foodies.","50"
"mr_branford","Not just because of the Michelin stars, the stunningly original food and service are things we will remember for the rest of our lives. Wine over 20 euros per glass but outstanding collection.","50"
"rominam570","A dance. It's what you get when you visit Geranium. The food it's what you can expect from its name, but it's more than that. It's a beautiful show as well as perfect food. It's an experience you have to make if you're staying in Copenhagen. You will feel at home, and welcomed. And you can enjoy your evening. My visit was in November, 2015.","50"
"tobeslo","Geranium is one of the most beautiful dining experiences that my wife and I had. It was a mesmerising journel that chef Rasmus Kofoed and his team had created for their guests and it's a personal one of gastronomic discovery.  We arrived at the restaurant early and were their first guests in this intimate place that had 12 tables. The space and simple decorations of marble, mirrors and floral arrangment of Scandinavian flowers matched tastefully. The natural light through the large windows added life to the space.  We had the full degustation of with all ingredients from Scandinavia, including Jerusalem artichoke, king crab, clam, scallop infused in hay aroma, oysters, duck heart, grilled lamb. They were presented in such a romantic way; and each dish brought us this extra pleasant surprise. We looked forward to the next dish with anticipation. I had the wine pairing and my wife the juice pairing; they were just spot on, perfectly and meticulously delivered.  We were invited like other guests to have a meal in the kitchen. We had ours the desserts, which was quite fitting for a finale of our four hour journey and took photos with Rasmus and his amazing team from the heart of the restaurant.  We had our coffee and petit four at the lounge area looking out the windows over the surrounding of the suburb, while talking to the manager over different subjects. It was relaxing. It's not just about food but the appreciation of Scandinavian culture and culinary beauty that we had just gone through.   We were the first to arrive and last to leave at 4:30pm. This was an amazing experience that is still in our memory fondly.","50"
"Lambirdy","Nice restaurant. 3 stars. In stadium. Routine staff. Expensive. €26 per glass. Tour throughout the restaurant which is Nice. Small portions. Lot of international staff. Owners were not present. Very quiet kitchen. Hard chairs","40"

"Will V","My partner and I visited Geranium for dinner recently as a birthday treat. The food was, of course, wonderful, but it was only part of the overall experience. It was excellent in all aspects, without being showy.  The restaurant itself was spacious and relaxing, with a nice view over the parkland in the north of the city. Indoors, our table had an equally nice view of the open-plan kitchen area, where we could see the chefs preparing our dishes (they were calm, quiet, and efficient in their work; not at all loud or chaotic as kitchens can be).  The courses were served by different members of staff, including waiters and the chefs themselves. The staff seemed genuine and their interactions with us felt natural and conversational. They were attentive, but not *too* attentive, and were very good at being there when you wanted them, and keeping out of the way when you didn't!  After the savoury part of the menu and before the desserts, one of the chefs came to talk to us and find out how we were doing, and then took us on a tour of the restaurant. He showed us round the back kitchens, chatting to us about how the restaurant operates, and let us explore the wine cellar, before leading us back to our table for dessert.  As for wine, we only tried a small sample of their cellar – two of the wines that were suggested on the full wine pairing – but they were excellent. Our sommelier knew his stuff, and at his suggestion we tried their apple and chamomile juice: also delicious.  Overall, the evening was comfortable, the food delicious, and the service seamless. We'll be going back when our budget allows!","50"
"lauraW564YS","Delicious meal, great service, unique wines. Each course was beautifully presented and quite creative. Nothing ended up being what I expected based on the menu descriptions but I was pleasantly surprised. I was full early on in the meal but found myself forcing so as not to miss anything--each individual course was light but there were many of them added together to make a robust meal. Did not need dinner after eating a lunch like this. Pricey, but a memorable experience and not at all stuffy. Beautiful space with open kitchen. Comfortable which I find important (and often lacking) for meals of this length. Highlights were the Jerusalem artichoke, scallop, and mushroom and truffle soup-really generous portion of truffle and the truffle glazed walnuts added nice texture. Playful dishes.","40"
"delaney_jason","We travelled to Copenhagen on a foodie trip, mainly to visit Geranium. And we timed our visit less than a week after it was voted the 19th best restaurant in the known universe.   I've had a little experience with Michelin-rated taster menus before, and I have to say that this one was worthy of the hype. The creativity, ingredients, skill and determination that go into the menu is phenomenal. And the sommelier was equally as impressive - dodge the pairing wines at your peril!   The tour was a nice touch, particularly in such surroundings as the national football stadium. The staff really did make us feel special, and we reciprocated that with genuine interest in their work. Anders was a really good laugh.   Not many people get to experience a 3 star restaurant. I'm very fortunate to have done so in such an incredible place. An experience (and a hake dish) that I'll never forget. The other 18 have a hell of a lot to live up to!","50"
"fukuronk","Went with my husband, Mikkel to celebrate his career new phase. All the food tasted as the original good taste of the food itself plus amazing arrangement and fun play with flavours. All the fishes were art works and show in the mouth. If you have few hours, energy and good appetite, including alcohol consumption, you will have a wonderful dinner for sure","50"
"FrederikW22","If you get the chance and have the money, GO! We were lucky to get a table during the evening service.  This was an amazing experience with waiters that knew everything and at the same time were very informal about it! You were pampered from the moment you entered and the food and wine matches were absolutely astounding! My personal favorite were the truffle covered walnuts with mushroom soup and white spring truffle grated on top with a 2006 Rioja that enhanced and fortified the delicious smell and taste of the mushrooms! In general this was more art than food said in the most positive way possible!  If you're up for something special ask for one of their mezcals as an avec!   The tour of the kitchens and the wine room was inspiring to say the least!  Very positive and money well spend !","50"
"Shannon43omg","Truly a once in a lifetime experience for me. The food was outstanding, the attention to detail unparalleled and the service was excellent. The wine pairings were unique and added to the flavour of the food (if that's even possible!). If you can snag a seat at the chef's table it's the best seat in the house! A fantastic experience from beginning to end.","50"
"Bangsgaard_London","Rasmus continues to deliver the absolute best dinner available globally and so happy he continues to get the 3*...Not only is it state of art in terms of how it is delivered but the taste and feel afterwards makes it extraordinary...What was special this time at Geranium was the Norwegian waiters who entertained us the whole evening and was the reason we did not leave until 01:00!","50"
"Edinburgh83","This is the kind of restaurant that's a bit embarrassing to admit you've eaten it. The cost is fear-inducingly exorbitant. It's the kind of thing you have to declare when applying for a mortgage, which is a fair comparison to what you'll pay.   On the upside is ... well, everything else. There's one menu but allergies are well catered for. It's intelligent, delightful, delicious, precise cooking. Wonderful ingredients, sublime cooking, extraordinary trompe l'oeil but never at the expense of flavour. Wines are mostly well matched, and with good thought. Service is, naturally, flawless and very personalised.   We sat at the chefs' table and saw the teamwork and continuous precision that is one of the world's great kitchens in full flow. The result is exceptional - not a league of its own, but a league that few other restaurants play in, even when they have three Michelin stars.","50"
"Dr Neil G","What a superlative experience this was. I should add that this is a considered summary because we eat out a lot, in different standards of restaurants and in different cities.   The menu consisted of 17 tastings and in what was a first for us, we also opted for the wine pairing. The food was very good, as you would expect from a three star Michelin restaurant, and so it's the other stuff that becomes important in determining whether you've had a good, overall experience. The staff are friendly, efficient and all speak good English. I say all because you do meet most of them as different chefs, sommelier, and general waiting staff all take turns presenting and explaining each course. The staff also changed our table at our request, which is not always the case in fully booked restaurants. Some establishments are sniffy about tables, using them as some sort of control over customers; not so Geranium.   The kitchen opens fully into the dining area so you get a good view of it working.The overall impression is one of calm but efficient organisation delivered by about 15 chefs, overseen by the equally calm management of Head Chef and co-owner of Geranium, Rasmus Kofoed. And you'll probably meet him too because he also takes turns presenting courses to each table. It seems Geranium is a very equalitarian establishment.  Before being served desert you have the opportunity for a bit of very gentle exercise because you're offered a behind the scenes tour. It's worth doing because it emphasises the efficiency, organisation and calmness that you see front of house. For football fans you also get to see the pitch through a window. It may seem strange having a restaurant on top of a football stadium but once you're seated you wouldn't know it's there; although like us you may occasionally have to walk through the crowds on match days to get to the elevator that will whisk you to the top floor of the stadium.   Would we complain about anything? Perhaps only one small thing. The service is very efficient and the courses keep coming with unfailing regularity. Given each course is only a mouthful or two, you may not think you're eating a lot but once we got about halfway through, we began to realise how much we'd actually eaten. A pause every now and again would be helpful. But this didn't detract from what was a hugely enjoyable and memorable experience.","50"
"KPugh1","We're big foodies, The Fat Duck, Le Cinq etc we've done.  Without a doubt Geranium was right up there. Location seems strange in the football ground but once you're in, it's amazing. Classically elegant Scandinavian style.  The open kitchen with all dining seats facing the chefs is a great idea.  The food is first class, highly innovative focussing mainly on fish/shellfish and only one meat course.  Of course it's expensive, we paid £600 for two for lunch with juice pairings (nice idea but probably overpriced considering the wine pairings cost).  Nice tour of restaurant before desserts and staff were all what you expect from a 3 Michelin star establishment.  100% worth it and if you're debating whether to go, just do it!!","50"
"KateFD","Eating at Geranium is a cultural event as much as a meal. White hatted waiters rush around serving exquisitely presented food and the waitress 'introduces' you to each course and each wine. We enjoyed everything we ate and drank, but the pleasure came as much from the presentation, the service and the sense of occasion as from the tastes. We were also given the opportunity to tour the (immaculate) kitchens with one of the chefs. Certainly a memorable evening.","50"
"ChinaJoe889","From the gin and tonic before dinner to the digestives, it was a rather wonderful meal. A very sharing team delivered impeccable service and unforgettable food. My only regret was not ordering a full bottle of wine.","50"
"Lisa T","Arrived straight from the airport, having been delayed from Stockholm. The staff were extremely accommodating of our baggage and lateness! Eating here is an experience! The food was exhilarating and outstanding. The food was visually exciting and deliciously different. Each course is served from an open kitchen by a separate chef who is genuinely proud to deliver it and explain the course in such a non stuffy way. It is their art of food and display. Extremely clever! Exquisite tastes.","50"
"ManWhoAteEverything","Other reviews have rightly focused on the excellent food, staff and atmosphere and these give a good impression of this wonderful restaurant.  I'd like to focus on the 3 things that could easily be improved: 1) the overly-verbose wine waiter rattling-off his emotionless descriptions parrot-fashion and in a somewhat condescending tone. The producer of the vinho verde gives consultancy to various Portuguese companies apparantly. Really? So what? This needs to be re-thought because it is inconsistent with the otherwise excellent interaction of the staff with the customers. 2) the theatrical nonsense of opening a young, sediment-free and somewhat average bottle of red by cracking the neck 3) the really below average, crema-less espresso produced at the table by the equally theatrical hand-operated machine. The coffee did not do the rest of the meal justice. Apart from the above, everything else was as perfect as one should expect from such a highly acclaimed restaurant. ","40"
"Nupuvon","The question here at TriAdvisor: ""Is this one of the best meals you've ever had a restaurant?"" I have clicked on ""YES"" with no hesitation. However, it is not only the meal itself. I only can compare the visit at Geranium with a tour in Musee d'Orsay, or an opera in Scala. I do not go to these places very often, but any time I have been there, I still remember. Thank you for the experience!","50"
"Lea J","Denmark has one restaurant with 3 Micherlin-stars: Geranium, so all of us danes have to be very proud. No doubt that the restaurants has a very creative kitchen, nice service and a special atmosphere - but to me it is also a kind of the ""The Imperors new clothes"", A lot of small dishes - good food - but so small that you all the time are waiting for the main-course, which never came. A wine-menu with a lot of with wine - wines which somebody might find interesting because they were so strange that you don´t find them somewhere else. A lot of waiters and chefs all the time waiting for you to say how fantastic it is to visit Geranium, but if you put evrything together, you are a lttle bit dissapointed after having spent USD 500 per person for an unsual but not fantastic experience. I give the restaurant 4 stars because I am a dane and ""Yes, but Geranium has 3 Michelin-Stars"". Lea","40"
"Mer21maid","We had to try the only restaurant in Denmark with 3 Michelin stars... It was an amazing experience, and the small dishes were all presented as pieces of art. There are some drawbacks to this, for example that it is nearly impossible to serve warm soup (or anything else that has to be warm) in such small portions. However, I am of the belief that warm soup should be really warm, and cold soup really cold. Nothing in between as this really was. For me, the concept with an open kitchen and millions of waiters and chefs running around in the restaurant does not work. I prefer the opposite - one single waiter and a very calm and relaxed atmosphere. It was not unpleasant at all, but just not a preference of mine. We were offered the table very close to the kitchen, but I was very happy that we declined! The food was obviously incredible, and minuscule dishes kept coming. The razor clams were unbelievable, as so were the dill scallops. Such an incredible amount of focused work go into each dish, and the Michelin stars seem absolutely well-deserved. Maybe I'm just not a Michelin person. The combination of factors like the setting, the always cold dishes, the very Nordic extremely mild (sometimes borderline tasteless (the turbot)) flavours in combination with the exorbitant price justifies that I can only award Geranium with 4 TripAdvisor stars.","40"
"pjensen2","Without question the best dining experience ever. You see here why food at this level is not just eating but also a demonstration of techniques and creativity. Only one menu available, in total more than 20 servings; I found no weak dishes in between. Every single bite was simply perfect in texture and taste, and dishes were generally visually stunning creations. I do not want to describe everything here into detail because that would simply be impossible. I'd rather recommend going there yourself and experience it first hand.   Competent and knowledgeable service who met you every time with a smile, professional to the bone. If the kitchen demonstrated food, the floor demonstrated first class service.   Is it expensive? Well, it costs money, but I guarantee that is an experience of a lifetime. Worth every penny.","50"

"gauravagarwala123","12 of us dined here on Jan 19th. We came with sky high expectations having dined at many michelin stars before. I have to admit the first look of the restaurant was fabulous, the servers seemed impeccable and the menu look sumptuous.   As the courses kept coming we kept getting amazed at the taste and the presentation. Was truly 3 star. The service too matched up to the dishes.  The only down side to this meal was the wine pairing. We payed 500 US dollars a head, the quality of wines did not match up to the price tag at all.   Another observation from the vegetarians in the group was that the potions were too small and insignificant.   We were celebrating a birthday and frankly they did not do much that was special for the birthday girl.   All in all I it was a fabulous experience, overpriced for sure but worth the experience.","40"

"msbee2014","I was taken as a guest so can't advise on price (though obviously expensive) but it was a truly memorable meal with a very imaginative winter tasting menu including some dishes which sound unappetising eg tomato water with ham fat - delicious! Each looks like a work of art eg golden leaves created with Jerusalem artichokes and dill pebbles filled with scallop. Very unstuffy for a 3 star Michelin with a very friendly young staff. I was a bit cold and they brought me a shawl. Nice views. And a tour of the kitchen.","50"

"Gabriel H","We had heard of Geranium and made reservations well in advance of our arrival to Copenhagen. The restaurant is located on the outskirts of the city, at the top floor of an athletic facility, a somewhat unconventional location. When we stepped out of the elevator, we found ourselves in this beautifully, if simply, decorated penthouse, with large windows providing a 180 degree view of the city. While the reception had difficulty finding our reservations, the staff was very gracious and accommodated us anyway. We had the best table in the place, overlooking both the bar and the rest of the restaurant. Service was impeccable all evening: from the welcome cup of champagne, to the presentation of each dish, a work of art in itself, and the careful and unpretentious explanation of the ingredients, process and the appropriate wine pairing (which we gladly accepted). The menu lists about 20 dishes, all small, and all incredibly well thought through, prepared and presented. There were accompanied by nine different wines. We have dined in most Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, New York, Budapest, Italy and Japan, but this was such a display of innovation, creativity and industry, we were thoroughly impressed. The Jerusalem artichoke leaves with walnut oil and rye vinegar was a revelation. The Mackerel with horseradish and Dill juice kept us guessing while we delighted in the harmony of flavors. The celeriac with scallop and trout was divine! The vegetables with oyster, cauliflower and elderflowers didn't correspond to what we imagined on paper: it was much better. The king crab in cabbage was amazing as were the desserts and sweets. I stopped counting after a while, but I'm sure there were several amuse-bouches interspersed in between the listed dishes and each dish was presented with such joy and pride: you could tell the staff was very proud of being part of this team. I often have issues with wine pairing and disagree with some (and sometimes all) the selections. This time, I was delighted with every choice. We left grateful for the few hours of pampering and culinary delight and will remember this dinner for many years to come.","50"
"Chelsea Z","Geranium is by far one of my best tasting experiences. The food melts in your mouth with every bite. The flavours have all been very well considered, and at the end I was so satisfied I didn't want to return to reality. I did the degustation menu with matching wine. I would recommend just doing the degustation menu and ordering your own alcohol as you see fit. A lot of courses meant a lot of alcohol, and for me it was too much wine in the end to truely appreciate the well crafted cuisine. But other than that silly decision on my part, the food was outstanding, the service impeccable and the space was lovely. Highly recommend it if you're in Copenhagen and want to treat yourself.","50"
"AndreasV502","I was here with my former job to celebrate a succesfully finished project. The fact that we got the budget to go to Geranium says something about the project's size and associated workload, so we were 7 happy consultants who felt like Christmas had come early.   The food is absolutely astonishing. I have some experience with foams, emulsions and the like, but this is my only time at a place that really does molecular gastronomy.   Sometimes it was unclear what in the elaborate arrangements you were actually supposed to eat, but everything was delicious - even the completely ""charcoal on the outside"" potatoes were amazing.","50"
"Thebeesknees100","Very lucky to be my third visit to this amazing restaurant and the first one since it has been refurbished. Prep area is now in the main restaurant, so whilst you now no longer have one course in the kitchen, it opened the restaurant up and given the eating area more atmosphere.  Nothing can describe the food, its just beautiful works of art with fabulous ingredients - you must, if you have the opportunity go.   Its a theatre from start to finish and does take an afternoon - we've never left before 5pm (starting at 12pm) and whilst expensive is absolutely worth every penny. Can not recommend it enough and the staff are completely wonderful.","50"
"362berkee","Geranium is a Danish wonder. I had one of my best tasting experiences ever.  The design is simplistic yet very bright, focusing you on the food. Our sommelier was very good and the wine menu design was excellent. Though I wish I could have St.Claire Estate Chardonnay from NZ since I believe it would fit perfectly with our menu. My regards (:  Well, the food was excellent and quite original. There are almost more chefs and waiters than there are guests. I loved how that many people explained the dishes in an alternating manner.  I would definetely revisit Geranium when I come back to Copenhagen.  Oh, also we went there by lunchtime NOT dinner. It was so bright that we experienced every small detail about the venue and the food. I recommend lunch time, definetely worth sacrificing the night.","50"
"292charliee","Although not technically a Scandinavian restaurant the clean, fresh and uncomplicated style of the food meant that it really did fall into the style. We enjoyed our visit and caught up with our daughter before heading on to Iceland. Highly recommended","50"
"A K","Luckily for me, I was able to get myself a reservation the day I was leaving Copenhagen, and although it was for a lunch reservation, I took it.  Simply put, this is as of yet the best meal I've ever had. Not just because every single dish was spectacular in its own right, but because the menu made so much sense. No dish belonged anywhere else, except for the exact spot on the menu where it was.   The waitstaff were informal yet informed, and happy to help with any questions, or frankly anything at all one might ask for.   Of the 17 course menu(I had the Late Summer Universe), the highlights for me were: in the appetizers-The ""dillstones"",and the ""razor clam"".  Mains- the salted hake, wild herbs with leeks smoked pork fat and melted ""vesterhavs"" cheese, and the pork on the ""bone"" which was absolutely fantastic. Desserts-the wood sorrel and woodruff dessert was perhaps the greatest dessert I have ever had, alongside the Turnip mousse with maple granita at semilla in brooklyn. It was something that I hope makes it to the menu again.  Overall, presentation, staff, taste, flow of the menu, and how everything worked together were all perfect. The wine pairing wasn't nearly as exciting as the meal, but did complement each dish perfectly nonetheless. Furthermore, the wine portions are generous, and if you finish a glass ""too early"" it will get refilled with the same wine that is intended for that course. this of course is done with no extra charge. The only strange part of the restaurant is its location, with it being on top of a soccer stadium. But getting beyond that, the view is actually quite nice, and the meal itself is undoubtedly worth it.","50"
"Bjorn O","I have had the pleasure of dining three times at Noma and now twice at Geranium. In my last review of Geranium of June 19, 2014 I speculated (correctly) that Geranium would get their 3 Michelin stars before Noma, although in my view Noma had a slight edge.  My wife and I decided to try Geranium again now with 3-stars. We enjoyed the Geranium Autumn Universe menu superbly presented. Compared with our first visit the international staff appeared more confident and informal (in a positive sense), although a bit fast at times to take out dishes before we had finished the course.  The ’17-course’ meal was definitely a level better than last time, lots of new interesting combinations. Of the Appetisers my favourites were: the ‘Dillstone’ Horseradish & Frozen Juice from Pickled Dill and the ‘Razor Clams’, it does not get much better than that!  Of the main courses the best were the Salted Hake, Grilled Limfjord Oyster. The Danish Wild Duck at the end was probably the best we have ever had. I still find the location at ‘Parken’ at bit odd, but once you enter the restaurant on the 8th floor you are greeted with a fantastic view. The meal took around 3.5 hours and was one of the most enjoyable we have had. The generous wine paring menu supplemented the different dishes perfectly. The juice paring menu is just too expensive for what it is.  Back to Noma, who has been gallivanting around the world doing pop-up performances in Tokyo and Sydney. I feel they have lost a bit of the plot, just too much creativity; but admittedly they are still fully booked months in advance. I will wait with my next visit to Noma until they have moved to their new location next year, when it will be interesting to try their new proposed concept of vegetarian food in summer, wild game in autumn, and seafood in winter.  Until then, Geranium is our new favourite restaurant in Denmark!","50"

A storm trooper truffle.","50"
"KonstantinVoronkov","I've been in many Michelin starred restaurants in different capitals and had visited this one even before it got its third star. We went there for a lunch. If someone says that they didn't understand what they ate, or that they left hungry - don't listen to them, it just means that they didn't understand and left hungry (if so, it is always possible to go and get Steff Houlberg sausage afterwords, and I am not kidding). This place is not about being feed. It's like you get your own piece of art and swallow it.  Chef came to our table to serve us one of the courses. For the coffee we were invited to the kitchen to the table with all his Bocuses. And something practical in the end: instead of wine paring we ordered a juice pairing. If you are there for a lunch, it's quite interesting option.","50"

"Andrew H","We visited Geranium for Lunch, an unusual setting on the 8th floor of the football stadium, however when the lift opens you enter a bright open area with lovely views of the surrounding park. The restaurant is not at all pretentious the staff are friendly and welcoming, in fact the staff made our lunch experience, I regret to say I forgot their names but we had two young Italians serving along with a young Frenchman, there banter was infectious, thank you to all three of them, a true credit to Geranium. I am not really going to mention the food in any detail, I suggest you book a table and go and experience the gastronomic delight, you will not regret it. Geranium is up there with the very best the world has to offer in food and it is the wonderful city of Copenhagen, what more could anyone want. Thank you to one & all who work there.","50"
"Tse Wing Y","I was fortunate enough to secure a dinner booking at this restaurant during my business trip to Copenhagen. I knew that it has received its three Michelin stars recently, and I certainly concur with those Michelin judges. The meal was extraordinary and the service was flawless.

Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like kitchen where you can see the chefs working. For those who do not book a table and are waiting, there is a cosy lounge with aged leather armchairs and pictures of polo players displayed on the walls.","50"
"DESNY","I've read soooo much about Geranium that I expected great food. So many accolades & gushing though that I was almost anxious that we'd be let down. I wasn't. I won't gush any more on the food because everything I read is true. I do want to carry on about how incredible the total experience for us made Geranium shine and really did feel like we wanted to hug everyone good-bye on your way out! The Welcome - elevator doors open and the warmest smile and familiarity in tone of voice instantly reassures you'll be well taken care of. Table: Not a sourpuss in the entire parade of folks who bring each course. Warm, funny, self-deprecating. A surprise after seeing them so serious in the kitchen, plating and taking direction - shear joy & pride when they presented at the table. It was infectious, it made us happy and glad we were came. At the end of dinner it was suggested we take coffee in the lounge. My first reaction was, ""really, the dining room is so great""...of course we said yes and to our surprise, the transition to the more intimate & romantic lounge was perfect. With fresh coffee being pressed table side, an after dinner Brandy in hand, the fire, the murmur from the dining room, we never wanted to leave. When we finally did, the additional touch of receiving a covered print-out of the menu (Fall), wine and juice pairing along with the other wine the Sommelier generously shared based on a Spanish wine we had tried and loved, was the perfect keepsake. I'm so jaded I was surprised at how sweet I thought it was. Car service was arranged and the driver came up to us. Perfection. Yes, we loved the food, but we really loved that the Geranium team knows that this is a special night and made all the right choices to make it just that! Thank you!","50"

"LauraS400","We are working our way through the list of Michelin star restaurants around the world, and this one is quite simply the best yet. Amazing views, amazing staff and above all, sensational food. Loved the fact we were say right next to the kitchen and you can literally see everything the chefs are doing. The staff are incredibly knowledgable and help make the experience the very best it can be. We did Noma the day before and as great (and memorable) as Noma was, Geranium is most definitely 3 Michelin star material and even better! Would love to come back to Geranium...... and Copenhagen very very soon. Do it - one of the world's very best abs this place will be in the world's top 10 soon, I am sure.","50"
"Twickerama","My husband and I ate here for an anniversary. We spent 5 hours there, eating the 20 courses (taster menu with paired wines). I thought it was heaven, but the price was eye-wateringly expensive!! My husband took a while to recover! The food was exquisite and the service impeccable. I absolutely loved it.","50"
"Neena K","The meal was expensive, at a little under $300 per person. But this was the best meal of my life. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. The staff was so friendly and attentive. Never pretentious. I had several allergies/food preferences that they worked around. I never felt like I was missing out or getting a lesser meal due to my allergies. Beautiful space that is a short cab ride from downtown. Tip: even if the restaurant is booked, put your name on their waiting list. They had a cancellation and that's how we got in for lunch.","50"

"chuklumba","we went to Geranium in August 2016 and really enjoyed the innovative and delicious food. The menu is more accessible than the likes of The Fat Duck and the service is warm and friendly. Every single course was delivered to perfection from the presentation, the service to the food and taste. A truly exceptional experience - at a price but worth it! We went for lunch I had the juice pairing and my husband had the wine pairing - took about 3 hours and cost apex £800","50"
"Chrispluspassport","Yes - it is an amazing experience. There were about 20 small 'plates' each different in terms of tastes and textures and each one a work of art. The feast provided takes you on sensory journey in a number of ways (sight, smell,taste) and you are introduced to local foods you will probably never have tried. There is a focus on locally grown produce especially local plants. The staff are superb. They are engaged and friendly and full of helpful explanations but never intrusive. We chose a bottle of wine rather than the matched wines with each course. The sommelier was very helpful. We were chatting to him about one of the matched wines - an Australian wine from a favourite vineyard - and when our party of three had finished our bottle we were all given a glass of this red wine to go with our final savoury course. I couldn't name a favourite course (although the 'burnt' potato was a revelation). It was the whole experience that was so amazing. Yes - it is very expensive. Put it on your bucket list and go anyway.","50"
"Foodie7523","Fantastic and innovative menu. If there is one thing I would have had different so it is that I would have liked to have had more supplies to certain dishes.

"AlfreK","Guess what? I went to Geranium with my wife and my two kids: Five and two years old. They behave fantastic. But a great dela was the treatment we got from the staff. Lets start: The place. On a top flor with nice views of the green side of the city, Spacious and elegant, with personnel that give attention to detail since welcome point. The food is extraordinary. You can see that many other restaurants are taking ideas from here. The presentation and the flavours shows and unbelievable consistency through the whole menu. And the wine pairing is great: Forget all those chef and sommeliers pushing you to eat advance food that taste like old not well done food. This was perfection. The gace of the place was total when we were invited to take one of our dishes at the kitchen. The chefs gave our kids two hats that my kids found super funny... and ALL the crew all stop service just to take a picture with us... and I saw their faces: no hesitation, no thing false, pure happiness of sharing their craft: This level of restaurants works on precision, they are Swiss clocks. And they just master it SO well they manage to do this for their guest. Geranium. Mindblower in all positive posible ways.","50"

"Hotfarm","In connection with a Bruce Springsteen concert in the Danish national stadium 'Parken' we had dinner in Geranium.   The concept was slightly different since we had 'only' 3 hours to finish our dinner. We nevertheless had 3 little snacks, 2 excellent starters a brilliant dessert and wonderful chocolate with our coffee. Only little hiccup was the 'pork chub' which was good and had a wonderful taste but was a bit hard.   And when such a fantastic meal is then combined with wines that compliment it to perfection ... then I'm in heaven","50"

"ThomasF7","This was our first time to try a Scandinavian Michelin rated restaurant, which we have heard and read so much. Our experince was exceeding our expectations. We have ordered the autumn menu, which has been launched few weeks earlier.  From the starter all through the main courses, the bread selection, fishes, wild duck was presented as part of the nature. No crazy design on the plates, yet elegant, clear and stylish every course we had. The waiting staff was superb, the Chef ....is a real down to earth, genuine kind person. When presenting the dishes, the waiter tells you the source of the ingredients, taking great pride of their suppliers and of their quality. They also have a really interesting winelist, we have ordered a bottle of Danish rose wine, which was a nice addition to our dinner. Since we have been there, the restaurant received their third Michelin star, which is well deserved. I must say we had a lifetime experience and I honestly hope we will have the chance to return.","50"
"NewSpidey","We had just arrived in Copenhagen a day ago and was still relatively jet-lagged. Still, the dinner at Geranium was great! Every dish was intricately designed and tastes great. Each dish was also introduced by the service staff (so that we do not end up eating what is not supposed to be ate!) While each dish is small, we were all very full even before the desserts came.  The wine pairing works much better than the juice pairing, and I would certainly recommend it.  Well deserving of the 3 Michelin stars that this restaurant recently got!","50"
"adspharm","As soon as you enter, you know this is going to be special: on the 8th floor with panoramic views through plate-glass windows and an elegant and spacious interior with round tables. The ambience is perfect, with smart waiters and waitresses flitting about and supplying your every need. The food is quite exceptional: the menu had 7 appetizers, 7 mains, 3 desserts and 6 sweets. But each dish is small to very small and you never feel as if there is too much. The tastes are amazing - delicate and subtle. The explanations given are very much part of the 'show'. We had the wine menu, 7 superb wines that fitted perfectly and which were well explained. Altogether, an experience not to be forgotton! BUT, when it comes to the price, you wonder if you will dare to return. The food menu was 1,800 DKK per person and the wine menu was 1,400 DKK per person. That means 200 DKK per glass of wine - high even in Scandinavia. Be careful about extras: one of our party had a glass of champagne to start with and that cost 500 DKK. A nice touch: you are given a copy of the menu when you leave. So, an amazing experience, but one that I will think twice about repeating. . Hence, I cannot give it 5 stars. But if you are not paying, go tomorrow!","40"
"igelmacero","The tasting menu while expensive is a treat for the eyes as well as the palate. Small plates artistically presented stimulate and delight taste buds that you did not know you had. The wine pairing is a lesson in enology. The setting is delightful with views of a gorgeous sunset and the service is attentive and impeccable.  A gourmet delight.","50"
"MobileDane","My expectations were at the highest as I entered the spectacular panorama at Geranium on a lovely spring evening, my second visit, after a truly fantastic night with family there three years ago. Now the place even has the three stars, and this time I was alone, in good shape and with a total focus on the pleasures to come. And it was a great experience, the place is magic, the food innovative, beautiful and sometimes ridiculously tasty, the wines out of this world, and the service… well the service is good but in my opinion the weakest point, actually. When you have so much time for yourself you can notice things more, and with the high level, high ambitions and high price of Geranium I think is fair to be critical if you experience things that does not please you so much. First, the menu and the oral introduction promised 21 courses, including several snacks. In fact it was 18. Does it matter? Yes, because nearly all of them are really small, several just a bite, not just the snacks but many of the starters too. No mistake, nearly everyone is a delight for eye, nose and/or palate (with the exception of my first starter, a novelty containing smoked oyster with an odd concentrated taste that I could simply not finish even if it was 2-3 bites only, and I am quite used to harsh North Atlantic fare). But only after three hours or so when I finished the final main dish before deserts, a really good pork serving, did I feel I would be able to leave the place without yet feeling a bit hungry. That and partly the desserts saved me. But just barely; I could certainly have eaten more, if more had been offered. I asked for a cheese selection or trolley as extra, but that is not available. Somewhat strange for a three star in a cheese loving country, but cheese was used in one of the dishes and maybe master chef finds this to be enough. I cannot praise the wine selections by sommelier Søren Ledet enough, though; that and the visit to his cellar surely made my evening; I especially can’t forget the super Tuscan accompanying the pig, and the delicate Veltliner Eiswein with the sweets. With so much to drink I usually find something to complain about (!) but nope, not his time. I would trust this man with my Lamborghini or my daughter, or both, if I had any. As for service, with lots of educated personnel orchestrated to make everything work you are of course generally served well but to me it seemed sometimes quite mechanical and not so customer-focused. They like to explain things to you, but are must less prone to listening, or responding to requests. I was sitting clearly visible by the window in the middle of the room but at least a couple of times had to wave my full arm (mostly in vain, actually) at waiters racing right by but not responding to smiles, slight waves, or ‘ahem’s. In one case if I could get a dish (the pork actually) gone completely cold before it hit me replaced. I could, but it took quite some effort to get it into the battle plan. Especially one (Danish, like me) waiter was very self-assured; you could sense she had many things going on, and not too interested in serving someone like me (starting her own place on the side, or releasing a fashion brand online, perhaps?) The foreign waiters seemed more professional and friendly, playing their part better. It is not a given, though, I have experienced the most wonderful charming, effective local waiters at other Copenhagen restaurants, and also at my previous visit to Geranium. Maybe this is just a lesson not to go alone to G, or if you do, bring your mobile device for entertainment, rather than hoping to be charmed by the crew. 21 or 18? They said to their defense that the three small after sweets count individually, to me that is a bit like cheating. With no cheese I asked for an after dinner drink, hoping maybe for some more small extra bites, but was told ‘we don’t do drinks’. OK, I should probably have been explicit about a whisky or a brandy, but maybe they wanted to get rid of me? When exiting I had the nerve to complain a bit about it to another waiter and I was offered a drink on the house (so they do have them…) and more deserts but at this time I was done with Geranium. I nevertheless left in a wonderful mood and took my bike to the nearest pub for a beer and some chips, and nice chat with folks there about my excellent, yet slightly, what is the word, glossy? experience at Geranium. I will be back, though, if I can find the money: The entrance! The wines! and The ‘kulmule’!, which is by the way the best fish dish I ever had, period. But I just can’t make myself give the experience full five points.","40"
"Wan T","In a weird location - right next to a sports stadium. Don't let that put you off. It's a modern building with stone, hard edges and white walls. Then you have lichen encrusted branches and nature dangling from the ceiling. It was beautiful. The cuisine gets my 'FVHS' award (food of a very high standard). Be prepared for the unexpected. Great staff, an amazing wine cellar and a genius chef and support team. We loved every second of this experience. But if you just want a 5* meal without any fuss then this probably isn't for you. Worth a detour.","50"
"Gryphon1403","Even though it's a 16 course meal, the courses are perfectly sized and weighted and leaves you feeling perfectly satisfied. Food is beautifully presented and a chef explains each dish and finishes it at the table. A great experience from start to end.","50"
"janpki","Was invited for birthday meal. Great atmosphere, relaxed and not at all stuffy like some other top restaurants. Friendly staff. The food was prepared/assembled in kitchen which is in the actual dining room. 20 or so courses of exquisite morsels of food art presented by each responsible chef. Visually stunning and unique flavour explosion with each course. Amazing experience. Only little criticism is that there was nobody to advise on the extensive wine list, no sommelier.","50"
"keithm06","The location within a sports arena is suspect at first, but the concept and execution of culinary exploration at Geranium. All details are attended to in complete fashion to ensure that nothing will detract from maximum food experience. 17 courses, pair with wine or juice provides an exploration of Scandinavian fresh cuisine and almost guarantees a new taste/texture/combination for all. If taking lunch, plan 3.5-4hrs.","50"
"Maria B","The experience of eating in Geranium was amazing. We were lucky to be able to book a table for lunch during our 10 day visit to Copenhagen last month. All the dishes served were elegant and well presented, though not necessarily bringing out the flavour of the ingredients. As a diabetic, I was offered cheese to replace the deserts. Unfortunately the cheese was too strong for my taste and the portion was too big compared to other dishes. It was an anti-climax to the carefully crafted preceding flavours. As there was no other dish to follow the cheese course, I watched my husband enjoying his three deserts on his own. I then wondered why the waitress bothered to ask us about food allergies when we came in. When my condition is noted, restaurants usually serve me some beautifully prepared fresh fruit or even something savory to accompany the other parties on the table. Diabetes is a common condition and restaurants should cater for this.  The incident certainly dented my impression of the service standards of Germanium.","40"
"Travellover D","Lovely Danish Michelin restaurant with Kofoed as chef serving superb dishes Always with his touch of nature. There is Only one Like him who masteres serving fantastic food together with handpicked green s from the nature. However, to get 3 stars and make it that extraordinary there must be intelling informed waiters who do not need to ask somebody else to receive the answer from. I asked her how geranium can have 3 stars if a waiter does not know what's on the plate to which she said, if a person from the guide was visiting, we would never put a waiter like me on the floor....well... This is our forth time and maybe the last. So many powerful luxury restaurants in Denmark with one or two stars . Winesellar has become nice since the new investor has a.mush more clever and popular taste than Mr.Ledet and putting some of his own collection in the.restaurant makes it interesting.","40"
"Wondergal1111","The restaurant is located behind Copenhagen football stadium, a little far away from the tourist attractions. After we checked in and get seated, we were told we can freely take pictures, walk around the restaurant and kitchen (open kitchen), and chat with other diners. It created a relaxed atmosphere as compared to other Michelin 3 star restaurants.  There was only 1 testing menu to choose from. Local ingredients were used for each dish. I opted for juice pairing instead of wine. Most of the dishes were presented by a team of chefs. I got the WOW factor on most of the dishes on the menu, they were creative and delicious.  I also applaud their effort for making adjustment to the menu for my mom who is lactose intolerant. While most restaurant would skip the dressing or sauce containing dairy, Geranium chefs made a different sauce and dessert that taste equally delicious.","50"
"Jezblanc","Oh just where to start....  Firstly this resets the bar for giving 5 stars, this simply was the best meal I have ever had.  We had the 17 course menus which consisted of a number of snacks to start and with paired wines.  Two snacks which stood out where the Tomatoes water with ham fat, where the ham fat congealed in the liquid with some intense bacon flavours, then the almost to good looking to eat Razor clams which were a work of art. Texture and appearance just amazing.  Mains and deserts following the same trend of labour explosions and texture games. Dill rocks and The Hake two other fine examples.  Wines paired wines were just incredible, natural and biodynamic but from real traditional producers.  Deserts were again an work or art and tasted just sublime.  We were also given a tour of the Kitchens, wine cellar and function room.  All in all an incredible and unforgettable dining experience, one to repeat for another special occasion.  ","50"
"mciuul","excellent food which is inventive without being contrived. Service is perfect, personal and easy without the snooty attitude which you may find in 3 mich-starred restaurants. A bit pricey - but what else can be expexted from the best. Actually worth it. Wine list is top class too","50"
"majai2014","The outmost best restaurant experience I've ever had. So many beautiful tasty dishes. We kept thinking that it could not in any way get better and could not understand why Geranium ""only"" had 2 stars. But only a few months after, they got their 3.","50"

"Peter B","Dinner and a show! It was the never ending story of food you never knew existed and now is finding hard to live without. Tried a few 2 star places before and this was our first 3 star.

"HappyDays32","Was lucky enough to secure a last minute table here for lunch.  The restaurant is located in a stadium which was a little unusual but just added to the whole experience.  All the staff (and there were plenty!) were lovely, service was friendly and impeccable without being overly fussy. We went for the 21 course tasting menu with wine flight - every dish was presented with an explanation from one of the many chefs (whom you can see working in the restaurant from all the tables) as well as each glass of champagne/wine.  The dishes were tiny (although there were 21 of them!) but impeccably presented and I enjoyed everyone of them! The champagnes and wines were also lovely - I particularly loved the riesling!   So this is definitely one for a special occasion (it came to just under £400 per person) but it is a once in a lifetime experience that I will treasure and never forget! Feel so privileged that I have had the opportunity to dine here and sample the whole geranium experience!","50"
"Charlotte D","Went on an ""average"" Thursday for lunch (had booked well in advance) - an what a treat to a day off!  From the moment you step in on the 8th floor, you sense that this is a place where nothing is random. Extremely serviceminded team - a welcome letter to ""great"" you at the table, with the menu on the back listing all the 7 appetizers, the 7 salty servings and the 3 sweet servings.  At the time for our visit the menu served was ""Geranium's Spring Universe"" - and all extremely delicious. It was served as a tasting menu, and it is difficult to highlight one special serving as my favourite as it was all well prepared and very tasty: it varied between soup, oyster, crab, potato, bread, vegetables, duck hearts and pork just to mention some.  It is Nordic and it is Michelin, wherefore the servings at times make you wonder: What to eat and how? But the staff was very cool and explained in detail, a.o. for the potatos: Eat the round black one (the potato), and avoid the coal itself, even though it might look like a roasted potato :-)  You can choose a wine or a juice menu - or as I did, a few glasses of wine based on their recommendation. Nothing seems too big or too small, even though we experienced one minor misunderstanding for the drinks, but all corrected.  A huge thank you also for their willingness to pay attention to the sweetness of the desserts, where I aim for avoiding sugar content. I had very good cheese, but also special desserts were made. Lovely for once to join the others during the actual ""sweets"" (got a.o. a special pear-serving as well as carots with buckthorn).  And in addition to it all we were fortunate to have Rasmus Kofoed serving also at our table. And I know the taste of the food itself is not about how the plate is put in front of you, but this does contribute to the overall experience. And having poured the sauce (might be called something different) on the dish Rasmus himself turned the plate just a few degrees to ensure that it looked the best, while being served. And yes details.., but underlines why Geranium deserves 3 stars and why you experience the attention to every little detail, which adds up to such a memorable lunch!  Not sure how easy it is to make a new reservation - but I will definitely try again and hope to spend another roughly 4 hours enjoying the menu served at Geranium.","50"
"kreeptown","This was a dream! One where we had an amazing 21 course mea, with wine pairing. You have to go if you can afford it, so amazing! The staff are exceptionally informed about every dish and wine and simply very nice. The chef's come out and serve their respective dishes.","50"
"772kimv","We left Geranium with a felling of something was missing to make the dining experience at Geranium worth another visit  We went to the restaurant just 5 days before the Michelin starred restaurant got its third star. And the food is really really great..  But..  The staff were not trained enough to back up the experience..  Just to mention a few mistakes:  We asked for champagne during dinner, but never got the champagne. It maybe not be a big deal as we also got wine and water.  We asked for more bread, but had finished esting before the bread came at least 30 minutes after.  We had a some simple question about the ingredients for some of the dishes, but we never got an answer.  We have no problem with english, but the staff were really not comfortable enough in english, which created confusion about ordering and translation when serving.","30"
"Anne-Louise Q","It was my birthday after all and when you want something very very special, and you love the best food prepared and served by the best chefs, then choose Geranium. Situated on the 8th floor of the Copenhagen Football stadium, it is an understatement of greys and textures. Your tables are spacious and the kitchen is in the room with you. Large picture windows give you an incredible view of the parks and skyline. The service was friendly and impeccable and we lost count of how many chefs and attendants served us. The staff come from so many countries that it exemplifies multiculturalism at its best. We were served by Danes, Italians, Irish, Polish and French, that I can remember.  It's a 21 course menu, with 7 appetisers, followed by the mains, desserts and sweets. You can choose the flight of wines or juice or not and no one bats an eyelid if you don't want alcohol. If you have had tasting menus before then you kind of know what to expect, but this is seriously good. It took us 3 and a half hours and we were served at that perfectly timed pace where every serving has time to be enjoyed before the next is delivered. A dill pebble with pickled cucumber granita, burnt potato (I can't tell you how incredible that was), Danish oyster, salted hake that looked like the marble on the plate, razor clams that you could eat all of (yes the shells too), duck hearts, happy pork and I've only mentioned 7 there. The other 14 were also perfection. We had to pay a deposit when we booked and the price is what you come to expect at this level of gastronomy. Seriously good. Whether you save as a very special treat, or are on a tour of the world's best places to eat, at Geranium you are eating food by the world's best chefs and that's official. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.","50"
"bonniebetsy","This was my favorite meal thus far in Copenhagen. Everything they create is beautiful and well worth the money. The service is also amazing and more relaxed than any other Michelin I've been to, which was surprisingly refreshing. A must go for any foodie! :)","50"
"D2662DWangelab","There is no words.. It was so complex, the service was excellent, the food was unbelieveable. Each dish had its own story... After the dinner our waiter showed part of the kitchen, and Rasmus's room, as they called: the inspiration room.","50"
"S D","Geranium has just received it's 3rd Michelin star - which seems to give it the right to cancel bookings, demand deposits up front . All in all a bit pretentious and there is more innovation out there without the hassle.","30"
"WhatEvil","My Fiancée and I ate dinner here in March 2016. We had the ""Spring Universe"" menu - she had the standard menu, but with anything mushroomy taken out (she doesn't like them) and I had the vegetarian version of the menu.  Starting with the dining space: The restaurant is fairly small. There only seems to be seating for about 50 people overall - this is nice as it's not too noisy and you're well looked after. There is no separation at all between the kitchen and the dining area - the floor covering changes and then there are worktops and lots of chefs working. I think there were about 15 chefs working at any one time for 30-40 diners. We were sat right next to the kitchen, which was nice as we could see what was going on and kept getting wafts of lovely smells. The kitchen was not at all noisy or disruptive. The atmosphere is not at all stuffy and there is no formal dress code. You would not be looked down on for arriving in jeans and a T-shirt here and there is nothing imposing about the way everything is presented or handled. All in all it's a nice and comfortable environment to enjoy the lovely food. The restaurant is situated on the 8th floor of the Copenhagen football stadium and I'm told this gives wonderful views, however we were there in the evening and we were seated away from the windows so we couldn't see too much. I don't feel that this detracted from the experience though.  Each dish is served to you by a different chef (though there may be some repetition). The chef comes out and explains to you what's in the dish, how you're supposed to eat it if necessary, and will answer any questions you might have about the food e.g. where the ingredients come from, what the idea behind the dish is etc. We were served one dish each by the two owners (the head chef and the sommelier) which was nice. All of the staff (both waiters and chefs) are polite, helpful and knowledgeable.  Both menus were incredible. There were ~20 courses and each one that came out was tremendously well put together. I only found one of the courses a bit disappointing, this was beetroot in cherry vinegar, from the vegetarian menu, which was not terribly exciting, but literally every other dish was fantastic. With so many courses, each one was obviously small but I felt at the end of it all that they'd got the quantity just right as I was definitely satisfied. All of the dishes were wonderfully presented and many of them came with aromatic seeds, leaves or small flowers as dressing, and these actually added a lot of flavour as well as looking pretty. Practically all of the dishes had ingredients, flavours or flavour combinations which we hadn't tried before. The dishes were certainly interesting but not so zany as to instill any trepidation. They did a fantastic job of substituting anything with mushrooms in for something else for my partner, and with the vegetarian menu I never felt like they'd just quickly thrown something together as a substitute for the main menu dishes - everything was clearly well-considered and delicious.  We asked our waitress to recommend a bottle of wine based on the sort of thing we like - my fiancée likes one thing and I like something slightly different. We explained and she brought out a bottle of Chablis for us which we both really enjoyed, so it seems she got it right. The wine pairing for the meal is quite expensive at 1400DKK per person (about £150) but we managed to have a bottle of wine for 700DKK last the two of us through from the starters to the end of the mains, and then we each had a shot of (very nice) spirits to see us through the desserts. I recommend Cognac to go with the desserts and sweets as it seemed to pair brilliantly with them. We were kept topped up with sparkling water at no charge for the whole night so this helped on the drinks front.  Between the desserts and the sweets we were offered coffee, which we went ahead with. It was nice coffee, and the waitress told us that it was a specific type which had been precisely weighed, with the water also weighed to get the precise amount, but we realised afterwards that they cost 100DKK per person (about £11) which seemed a bit steep for filter coffee.  All in all we spent about 5 hours there but it didn't drag at all and it seems they will go quicker or slower if you like. The evening was a wonderful experience. The total bill came to around 5000DKK for two of us (about £550) which is steep, but the standard of food was amazing and I highly recommend it.  My Fiancée has commented that there was a lot of seafood on the menu - this is understandable since the focus is on using local ingredients and obviously they have a lot of good seafood in Denmark. If you are not too keen on seafood you might want to ask them to substitute some of the seafood dishes with some options from the vegetarian menu, or I'm sure they would come up with some other substitution for most of the dishes if asked.","50"
"pilot1953","Found this very special place on TA! Extremly interesting menu, exotic and attractive... Excellent cuisine. Relatively noicy and 'dark'. To celebrate this high level dining I would prefer less noice and a bit more space between the tables.","40"
"bethyb87","having visited many michelin starred restaurants, had certain expectation. These were fulfilled and then some. the service was exceptional, from the champagne presentation to the explanation of each course.  While each course is minute, the fact you get 20 of them more than makes up for it. And when you finish you glass of wine on the wine flight, you are offered a top up, as well as more bread. There is lots of space in teh restaurant which is always pleasant and nice to see the chefs working. upon making a mistake with one of our courses, we were provided with an additional dessert which was a nice touch.# it is expensive, but so are a lot of similar restaurants.","50"
"Karinawh","This is by far the BEST restaurant I've ever visited. Came back for my birthday dinner - 4 days before Geranium received their 3rd Michelin Star - and I really get why they were awarded it.  Everything is absolutely AMAZING - right from the second you enter and are greeted by the staff. The appetizers are out of this world - I could eat the charred potato with sheeps butter every day! The mains again are stunning, wonderful and made to perfection. The hake with finnish caviar and fish scales is one of my favourite dishes - and the desserts are simply to die for. The beeswax ice with honey and the trees with dark beer and prunes were my favourites as well as the scull ""This is the end"".  The wine pairings are perfect - and I'd recommend to go all in for the bollinger champagne - it's LOVELY!! The service and the whole evening is beyond perfect. We had a lovely private tour where the owner and sommelier Søren Ledet showed us around and told us about the wonderful wines.  I can't wait to be back again! And I still need to rate this place 6 in stead of just 5 ;-)","50"
"Henrik F","This is a fantastic place. I have been there three times and all of them have been great and beyond. It is not only that the food tastes good, but every dish is so beautifully arranged, served with style in a classy place and always with a surprising twist. It is of course not cheap, but compared with the other high-end restaurants in Copenhagen you get better value for money.","50"

"dandandanmark","Everything delicious, every time they present a new course will just make you WOW. full of surprise, beautiful like picture!!! It's the best experience in my life and you can have a chance to take picture with the trophy in the kitchen and see how the chefs are making food!","50"
"Jensenkk","We had an amazing experiance here. We have tried many Michelin stared restaurants and this is one of the best. By far the best we had tried in Copenhagen including Noma. We had round 20 courses, and they were all very good. A lot of fish, and not much meat. The only downside is the price, it is very expensive.","50"
"Thomas Reidar A","My wife and I visited Geranium on a Friday night and was overwhelmed by the bright, modern and very Scandinavian decorated rooms. There is plenty of room in the restaurant so you also experience some private / intimate atmosphere. We got the menu with 21 servings - all 21 with very amazing sensory experiences - visually, in terms of taste, texture and scents. The service was excellent - and it was a great experience to be a guest. For those who want to pamper yourself!","50"
"Jonas P","Lots of beautiful courses and excellent wine parrings. However I feel that to get the 5th star at this price point the servings lacked a little in taste.","40"
"Natasha C","I have never felt so relaxed after a meal. It was wonderful from beginning to end. Everyone was very helpful. The chefs were kind enough to answer our questions on specific courses we particularly enjoyed. It was my partners birthday and they cooked him a special cake, and everyone we came in contact with wished him a happy birthday!","50"
"whowell2016","The 20 courses were a wonder to behold. The chefs delivered the courses and the waiter joined the chef in explaining the food.  The small potato with butter spoon and ham and tomato dish were my favourites.  We laughed and talked and eat for around 3-4 hours and it went in the blink of an eye.  Go and treat yourself to a memory you won't forget.","50"
"Hazel P","I am writing this review some months after our lunch at Geranium. This is because I had a copy of the menu and needed to find it in order to give an accurate description.  We needed to choose between Noma and Geranium, both of which have two rosettes in the Michelin guide. The hotel concierge said he would be able to reserve us a table at Noma as I was giving him enough notice. However, we would need to be flexible with dates and times as he couldn't guarantee we would get our first choice. With Geranium, we could choose when we wanted to go. He said we could book Geranium, and if we got what we wanted at Noma, we could cancel Geranium. I felt this was unfair, so we booked for lunch at Geranium and it was an excellent decision. The restaurant is airy with lots of space between tables and lovely views . There was a choice of two degustation menus, one offering dishes made from seasonal ingredients, the other with their most popular dishes . We chose the latter: I enjoy delicious food, rather than food that is simply experimental and surprising . This was one of the reasons I was not drawn to Noma. Our food was both delicious ,and surprising, each course being presented by the chef responsible for its creation: charred potato in Aroma from Bark and lightly Smoked Sheep's Butter, Biodynamic Onions with Chamomile and Melted Hay Cheese are some examples. There were two delicious dessert courses and an amazing selection of petits four with the delicious pour over coffee. Onion Caramel with Mirabelle was particularly memorable. We chose matching juices with our courses rather than matching wines, which was again novel and delicious.  Impeccable service, exceptional skill in the kitchen, and artistry on the plate that will surprise and delight you do not come cheap. However, if you want a wonderful dining experience without needing bragging rights to having eaten at the ""best restaurant in the world "", leave Noma to those who do, and try Geranium instead.","50"
"Paises-bajos","We had dinner here with a group of 6 and were lucky to have the table nearest the kitchen.   Wine pairing and juice menu both equally impressive  Very creative dishes.   Not sure about returning here. We have now been to Noma, Geranium and AOC and the 1st visit to this type of restaurant is the most impressive.   ","50"

"Kim M","Amazing food- we were pleasantly surprised with excellent presentation. The wait staff was friendly although we requested to speak to the sommelier and that wasn't done. The set wine paIring menu was shockingly mundane and pedestrian for the caliber of food. They clearly are more interested in the food than the wine which leaves the culinary experience a bit lacking. The interior is minimalist, the kitchen is open and interesting to visit. I didn't really care about the location or soccer field - that shouldn't really impact on the culinary experience. There wasn't a bad dish in the 20 served and we loved the food.I can only give 4 stars due to the complete lack of attention or care to the wine pairing - quite unbelievable for a restaurant of this caliber.","40"
"Anotation","I've been to a fair amount of michelin rated places across multiple continents (check my profile) and i got to say that my Autumn universe menu from Geranium completely floored me. Some of the plates were so darn good, i could only exclaim multiple ""wow...."" silently.  It was everything i could hope for in a meal. Flavors were on point, presentations were beautiful, the tiniest details done to perfection(although only noticeable to some), it was posh yet playful, there was a breathtaking view from our table.  It was just.... perfect.   It completely made our 5 days trip to Copenhagen worthwhile.  Thank you to the team at Geranium, i am sincerely hoping to hear good news of 3* soon, it will be totally well deserved.","50"

"Mai H","There's not much that can be said about Geranium that hasn't already been said. I made this reservation a month before going to Copenhagen but didn't actually confirm (due to potential scheduling conflicts) until the night before and they were very gracious in allowing me to keep my reservation despite the late confirmation. We had the autumn tasting menu.  My friend and I went to dinner and it was an incredible 4 hour experience. It honestly could have been 5 hours but we had to rush through service due to having to get up at 6AM for a flight the next morning..luckily our reservation was at 7:30 but we didn't leave there until 11:15! Everything was divine! Since we came at night we didn't see the soccer stadium that everyone on TripAdvisor seems to complain about (hehe), the views were great for us! I loved the space and the seating arrangement for 2 is very lovely and comfortable couch..maybe *too* comfortable during the dining experience.  I didn't feel at all like the service was pretentious, it flowed and all the servers were very informative. I loved how everyone from kitchen staff to even the guy who was maintaining the front desk was serving us (and everyone else). That made it feel informal and just really nice. Food and presentation was perfect and well executed. There was nothing that arrived on the table that made me want to spit it out. haha and trust me, I've been to Noma, El Celler and many other fine dining restaurants that had at least 1 thing that made me go eww. So yeah, this was great! Would do it again for sure!","50"
"Brorson91","What a great experience there is to be had at Geranium. The location is very cool and you have a warm welcome too. The food and wine really impressed. Special mention must be made to the service staff and the chefs for being so hospitable despite being so busy.","50"
"Nikolaj H","We had lunch here in october 2015. The tasting menu served is the same for lunch and dinner. From booking and entry to exit a very fluent and relaxed experience. Geranium is a 2** restaurant with a view overlooking a large park on the skirts of central Copenhagen, easily accessible. The cuisine is modern - somewhere between nordic and french. 2 stars well deserved for the amazing food alone when you compare with 1* restaurants in Copenhagen and the 2** AOC (comparable) and Noma (something else entirely). The only ""but"" is the price of a meal here, clocking in at a whopping 500 euro per person with wine pairings (and a glass of Champagne) leading to a minor gripe. At these prices I expect the wine pairings to match the food, but as I've seen at a few other gourmet restaurants who do in pairings, once or twice during the meal the wine just isn't quite up there. I suggest cutting back on quantity (they refill generously) to up the quality. Off course, if you have a deep pocket the wine list offers what you would expect from a restaurant such as this. Service was great and personal all the way. We were invited to see both the kitchen and the wine cellar which was fun.","50"

"Josh and Vivian B","42 in the world! An amazing gastronomical experience with incredibly fresh local ingredients! It was quite an experience! They even give you the menu that is date stamped to take home as a keep sake! However, after a large bill, we weren’t entirely full. The dishes are cute little bites and nibbles. We’d say approach it more like an experience than a meal (We went out for huge steaks maybe 2 or 3 hours later).  We had an 18 course lunch with one person getting the wine pairing and the other a juice pairing. Note that the juice and wine pairings are not different for each course. With the 18 little courses comes only 5 juices and about the same glasses of wine. The lunch took around 2.5-3 hours so be prepared to stay there for a while.  Each table was lead into the kitchen for a couple courses. It was real fun to see the chefs work. The kitchen was so pristine even as they were working!  The view is quite beautiful. It’s located on a brilliant green field. Service was attentive and detail oriented. Once is enough though. It’s a lot of money to spend to not be full, but then again, it was a one of a kind experience.","40"
"USCKaboom","The best meal I've had has changed 2x now in 12 months. It began with Per Se, which was usurped by Alinea and now by Geranium. I was debating between here and Amass and I clearly made the right choice. The chefs and staff were impeccable, friendly, and gracious. Every dish is the 15 course Autumn tasting was outstanding, and the menu was only a day old! I could list out everything I ate and why it was so good but it wouldn't do Geranium justice. The menu was creative, tasty, and playful. I wish I could do it all over again. While I'm sure Noma is excellent I couldn't get a reservation, and while not easy, Geranium is certainly easier to get a reservation at. Also, I wasn't made to feel like less of a patron for not getting the wine or juice pairing. Just not my thing. But my server was kind enough to bring me a glass of wine that balanced perfectly against the meat course.","50"

"LilyE79","My husband and I will look back on our lunchtime visit to Geranium as a high-point of our trip to Copenhagen.  Everything about our visit was smooth and immaculate, starting with the warm greeting from the hostess, to the knowledgeable and friendly wait-staff. Service was just as service should be in this type of venue, we never wanted for anything and yet never felt interrupted.  The decor was clean, in tones of grey and white, very nordic (equally it reminded me of the Almeida restaurant c. 2005) - people seem to rave about the views which we thought were fine but not amazing.  The food was outstanding, however I'd almost ruined the surprise element for myself by researching the dishes before we went.  We opted for the 21 course Universe menu with the juice pairing - some of the stand-out dishes were:  * Milk, fermented carrot, crab and sea buckthorn oil - which was like a little, creamy, zingy panna cotta laced with sweet crab.  * Charred potato and lightly smoked sheep's milk butter - which my husband proclaimed was the 'best thing [he's] ever eaten'.  * Seaweed and razor clams.  It was a truly memorable 3.5 hour lunch and we thank the staff for making it so special.  Of course it's mind-blowingly expensive (approx. 550GBP for a lunch for two) however I find when we visit expensive restaurants that any plans for thrift leave me the moment I walk through the door (my mental note not to order a Champagne aperitif deserted me by the time we were seated).  Some reviews have noted that they didn't leave full, however maybe because we chose the larger menu we left too full to even consider dinner (we both have 'healthy'* appetites).  *often unhealthy  So why 4.5 stars rather than five?   It's a weird little picky thing, but one of the things I like about the concept of honest food, which is often foraged, definitely locally sourced and consciously made is the notion that the menu is ever-changing to reflect the seasons and availability of each foodstuff at its best - however with Geranium I noticed that their menu, though tweaks are made week-to-week, is pretty much standardised over a season.   Also, and this is an even pickier thing, I wasn't overly keen on the texture of the chicken (one miss out of 21 dishes isn't bad) and my husband had a piece of gristle in his which I wouldn't expect of a restaurant of this calibre.  We had a lovely time, we would definitely visit again, it's not 100% perfect but what is?","40"
"Kenneth T","On a trip in Scandinavia with a foodie bias. Schedule made us do lunch rather than dinner. As noted the location a bit surprising-a corner with private entrance at the soccer stadium- but the views over the nearby park and city are terrific. Service impeccable on the ""summer univers"" tasting menu which we did we wine pairings. Every course was a delight to the eye- and the favors matched. Some favorites a razor clam appetizer where the 'shell' had been recreated and was edible. I loved a mackerel with horseradish. Wine well matched- very nice meursault from Pierre morey stands out. by chance Rasmussen Kofoed was having a birthday party for one of his young children in the room next to the restaurant- it was fun to see him and his family.  One issue worth noting- dinners at lunch often quite casual- be warned that bad choices in clothing is an international event- people at some tables were in shorts, tee shirts, jeans etc. if this bothers you do dinner- the upside if any is staff etc more casual and friendly- more banter. A tour of the kitchen is part of the experience. I think the comparators here are places like alinea, el club allard in Madrid with a similar molecular gastronomy approach- more than say French laundry or Mathias dahlgren in Stockholm which are more traditional in approach. This was excellent but would not top alinea-","40"
"Nete Keum J","The visit was at lunch and an impulsive one with reservations made just in time.   The serving was solid and in a pace that didn't make either my partner not myself stressed throughout the 3,5 hours long session.   Both the non-alcoholic and wine pairing menus matched the dishes, and whether to like or not, the Sommelier chose to serve juice for two of the servings for both the of us and understandable as the complexity in the dish was very high and would have been impossible to find a wine to assist.   We waited slightly too long for the dessert having the wine and juice served, meaning that the temperature of both glasses were incorrect once the servings arrived.   To my taste I would rather have avoided the visit to the kitchen, but I understand the background of showing the effort and hard work which is behind the scenes.   All in all, a good choice and a pleasant lunch","40"
"Judi2000","A 24-course mystery tasting menu is my husband's idea of culinary hell but luckily, I wasn't dining with him! My friends and I embraced the experience wholeheartedly and - several hours later - fell in love with the nature-inspired, tantalisingly delicious Nordic menu. Tiny Jerusalem artichoke twigs, mini mushroom consommé the size of a thimble, edible shells and a multitude of wines to complement the courses... this is an experience for the senses, so much more than a meal. We shared the triumph of the distant celebrating kitchen at the end, as it felt as if we had all accomplished the equivalent of an opening night at the Opera House. I would love to return, but without my husband who would have baled at at the end of the first Act.","50"
"DanielK694","I don't know what to say ... this place blows mind and taste buds. Service is superb same as you would expect from 3 Michelin star restaurant. I could compare service in Geranium to one which I have experienced in Gordon Ramsay's Hospital Road restaurant. Food was amazing. I didn't expect much when I walked in to this restaurant. Very simple and clean ambience. You don't feel like you are in place for snobs and people with loads of money which is amazing. We only went for smaller tasting menu as the same day we had dinner in Noma. Juice paring was amazing.","50"
"candy057","Simply put I was blown away, I am a serious foodie. I have been to most of the Michelin star restaurants in and around London, where I am based. But none of them compare to Geranium. This restaurant is so good, it is worth getting on a plane just to eat there. I cannot put into words what a pleasure it was to dine there for lunch last Saturday, I wouldn’t stop hugging and kissing the staff, if you are a Michelin star diner and you have not been yet, you are seriously missing out!  The only major down side of dining with them, is that now I’m back in London, I can’t be bothered to visit anymore Michelin star restaurants. It’s like being fed the finest steak in the world, then having to go back to chewing on burgers!!","50"
"BDAHiFlyer","We were told, if we were going to Copenhagen, we HAD to try and get a reservation at Geranium. We managed to get on the waiting list and were fortunate enough that there was a cancellation, so we were in.  Disappointment #1 was the location. It seems that it was located in a building that was part of a sports complex. Since, for me, the dining experience includes atmosphere (inside and out), this was not a good first step.  The restaurant itself is very modern, almost to the point of being sterile. When seated, it wasn't made clear to us that there was the option of a set menu or one we could select. In order to celebrate out being given the opportunity to dine here, we looked at the wine menu for some champagne. Imagine our surprise when we found that the prices were outrageous. We had several wine connoisseurs with us, so they know their wines and prices. Disappointment #2.  We chose the 7-course meal with wine pairings. As with this type of molecular gastronomy cuisine, the portions are extremely small, but some did have interesting flavors. The wines were well matched with the food courses.   We did have some difficulty with understanding the staff when they were describing the dishes and wines. Also, the attempted choreography of the servings was appreciated, but the timing was often off, which took away from the affect.   The final disappointment was when we were presented with the bill. When divided between the group, it was around $475 per couple. The experience was interesting, and tasty, but the price/performance ratio of this restaurant just wasn't there.  Having wined and dined in many a fine restaurant around the world, and with all of the hype given to us before hand, Geranium was a supreme disappointment.","20"
"kingdombythesea","When I go to a two Michelin star restaurant, I expect more than just good food. I expect a bit of razzle dazzle, I expect to be entertained... And I expect good food. Geranium met all these expectations. Everything was delicious and the flow of the courses was extremely well thought out. Naturally, there were some dishes that I swooned over - the charred potato and lightly smoked sheep milk butter; seaweed and razor clam; dillstone, mackerel, horseradish and pickled cucumber granita - and others that were less memorable. But overall it was simply fantastic, with consummately professional staff and classically smart interior.","50"
"Jensen88","Simply world class. My second visit. Yes, the restaurant is very expensive, but if you are seriously into modern haute cuisine, this is one stop not to be missed.","50"
"ssfay","Unfortunately I only had an average dining experience at Geranium. The restaurant itself was beautiful, and perhaps one of the best atmospheres for a romantic dinner, but I had expected a lot more from the degustation menu.   I had just dined at a certain restaurant that was #1 on the World's Top 50 list the day before which was simply an incredible experience, so that may have been the reason I felt a bit let down by Geranium in comparison. To clarify, there was nothing bad about the food. Everything was delicious - but it was just not as innovative nor did it have that ""wow!"" factor I was expecting from a 2 Michelin star restaurant and #51 on the World's Top 50 list.  On the bright side, we had a great time touring the kitchen and chatting with one of the head chefs who happened to also be from Australia. I hope to give Geranium another go next time I visit Copenhagen.","30"
"Peter S","This has 2 Michelin stars and the chef was in the kitchen during our meal. We had a superb meal, with the service being super friendly. Everybody makes effort. This is the fourth 2 or more star Michelin restaurant I have eaten in over the past 12 months, and so the ratings compare it to similar ones. This is one of the issues with TripAdvisor that is hard to overcome when considering the ratings. However, if you get a chance to go then strongly suggest you do so. Allow 3 - 3.5 hours for the full menu.   Having said this, there are other superb restaurants in Copenhagen. Details of the various courses we ate, and our opinions, are below. Of course, this meal was not cheap either. Initial wide range of inventive starters, some of which worked much better than others. We also had the juice tasting menu as the wine tasting menu was very overpriced (and it was lunch time), but only 2 or 3 of these really worked with the foods.   Starters Tiny pieces cheese bread in shape of wheat. Delicious morsel (5/5) Orange colored jelly with crab beneath (3/5) Kohlrabi and pear thinly sliced with elderberries on top - very interesting (4/5) Jerusalem artichoke wafer (5/5) with walnut cream and an oil (4/5) Apple packet- dried apple in Apple juice - stunningly beautiful but taste only so-so (3.5/5) Burnt looking small potato (blacked with squid ink) with Sheep milk butter on spoon (4/5) Mushroom foam over quails egg with truffles -(5/5)-served in kitchen  First main course - juice was apple strawberry Salted mackerel inside dill shiny gell shell. Cucumber (frozen) and dill cream and horseradish (5/5)  Second main course Juice- Apple and camomile tea juice- fabulous   Bread course- small and warm. Onion flower butter ok 3/5. Questioned whether bread and butter can really be considered a course !  Third main course Juice- Celery, cucumber, algae. Ok- went better with dish, but not that nice.   Scallop and oyster surrounded by shell with pea and celeriac juice (fabulous) - probably overall our favorite dish (5/5), although some of the party didn't like it much.   Fourth main course Juice - blackcurrant, lingenberry, and juniper- tart, but reasonable. Went better with the food than some of the others.   Chicken Mouse with juniper berries and black cherries -stuffed inside a chicken - purée from pickle and skin and a beer and tapioca. Looked fabulous but taste only so-so. Overall, a disappointing dish 2/5.   Desert  Juice- Lemon grass and raspberry - best juice  Grilled raspberries blackberries and frozen Sheep milk yogurt Delicious 4.5/5  Extra  Beetroot and Lingenberry - lovely Caramel - poor- chewy and not great. Pumpkin seeds - spongy. 2/5  Pine Eggs- chocolate ganache - fantastic. His signature desert 5/5 ","50"

"RobinBennett","We'd arranged to meet some friends for lunch at Geranium to experience the famous Danish ""uber restaurant"" scene. They were in Copenhagen for a birthday party & we were on a family city break and after trying (and failing) to book at Noma, we chose Geranium instead.  The location is a bit odd as other reviewers have said (it is on the 8th floor of the national football stadium!) but the views are excellent and the dining room is light and airy.  Service was perfect - really relaxed, very knowledgeable and very chatty. Everyone - including the chefs who sometimes serve at table - seems determined to make eye contact and really connect which is charming. The trip into the kitchen is also interesting and the insight into their almost laboratory-like working environment is an eye-opener.  The food is tasty, very Danish, and beautiful to look at. I really don't know if the flavours are enhanced by the seemingly hundreds of processes each morsel has gone through, but it certainly makes each tiny dish a talking-point and something to think about.  In fifteen or so courses only one didn't work for me although everyone else was very happy with it. The texture of the main course chicken didn't work for me at all - the reconstituted meats and mushrooms stuffed back into the chicken skins just felt ""grisly"" to me - but as I say I was a lone voice in not enjoying it.  The eye-watering price is frankly madness if you think of this as a restaurant meal... but if you think of it as an ""experience"" it makes sense. Sort of!!","50"
"SummerseatSally","We pushed the boat out with the Universe menu with wine pairing for my husbands 50th birthday.   We were at the restaurant for 3.5 hours, but the time flew by. More than 20 amazing courses were served specifically suited to our dietary preferences. We got taken into the kitchen for one of the courses - a new experience.  Service was outstanding. We were treated like a King and Queen and the waiters were professional, relaxed and friendly, not stuffy at all (as per some other reviews).   The food was totally amazing.   For us this was a once in a lifetime experience and Geranium didn't disappoint. Just remortgaging the house to pay the credit card bill now.......","50"
"18AndrewP","Wonderful food. Service first class. This experience for our 25th wedding anniversary could not be faulted. It is well worth a visit and the universe taster menu gave us the full range of dishes and snacks - all were absolutely sensational.","50"
"g2wain","Our lunch at Geranium was amazing - they took us on an unbelievable journey. We had the signature menu with juice pairings (yes, you read right, juice). The plates will beautiful, inspiring visually, olfactory and taste-wise. As it was summer, each course was illustrative of a place in summer - we started in the field, took walk in the forest, went to the beach and ended in the garden - in plating and flavours. The juices paire complemented the dishes perfectly. Service was good and staff were knowledgeable about food and wine.","50"

There is besides the fantastic wine menu also Juice menu to choose from, both are just outstanding. I can only say, when in Copenhagen, visit and enjoy","50"

"TSR71-Nguyen","Would really have expected more from a high end Copenhagen restaurant. Went for 5 courses with juice pairings and champagne to start. Presentation of the dishes was on par with expectations, the taste of the dishes nothing special. Razor clam was my favourite dish. Least was the main, chicken stuffed with chicken, which I only half ate but was forced to stomach all of by my wife (feels it rude not to). Pleasant surrounds and spacious tables, and expansive view from level 8. The service is a bit chaotic as the wait staff are constantly rotating between tables. Flabbergasted by some of the good reviews... as this was easily down the bottom of the list amongst the number of restaurants we dined at in CPH. Less personable service and more commercialised than other dining experiences that we preferred.","30"

"Alex D","Went one lunchtime for a 40th birthday... Just amazing. It sits in a non descript building north of the city but once there, everything is cattered for. The staff is perfect, the restaurant itself is small ish, tables well spaced so that you dont have to listen to the table next door. We sent for the full monty, is the 9 courses menu with matching wines. No regret whatsoever. The menu is fresh, fish and seafood orientated, nordic... Just amazing for all senses, and full of discoveries in terms of local plants, weeds, fruits. The wines were also really good and away from the usual 'suspects' from France, Spain, italy etc. It took us a good 3.5h to enjoy everything (they also did add an extra pudding once finding out this was a birthday lunch). One of the dish is served in the kitchen too, which makes the whole expérience superb.  As for the dresscode, i cannot say there is one. The entire expérience is very relaxed, we rocked up in jeans and nice shirts but saw other guests in shorts, tshirts and sandals. There is no pressure about it and i wouldnt expect any when paying a fair price to start with.  We will be back for sure!!!","50"
"gtpamlin1","My primary goals in Copenhagen were to experience the fine and creative dining experiences and Geranium did not disappoint.   I made a reservation approximately a month in advance, a recommendation for any of the top restaurants. I was able to take the bus from the city center, where it drops off right in front of the building. The entrance is on the back of the building, which is difficult to ascertain when you are standing in front. The restaurant (at lunchtime) is bright and sunny, overlooking the park, with a modern decor.   The service is attentive, the food is impeccable, creative, and I enjoyed the opportunity to go to the kitchen and observe preparations first hand. Every course has immense thought put into it, whimsical and delicious.   A truly memorable dining experience!","50"

They checked to make sure we enjoyed every course and obliged with our dietary requirements. The wait between courses was perfectly timed and we were not left feeing hungry at any point in time.  The food was immaculately presented and was sometimes too beautiful to eat, using natural stones, flowers and plants to decorate the servicing dishes.  This is a world class restaurant and I cannot wait to go back in the future.","50"
"kimh_vardl","This is so far the best restaurant experience ever! The restaurant is decorated beautifully, and the staff is as proffesional as possible, maybe to much and became a bit stiff sometimes. It all started with a selection of Champagne and perfectly prepared appetizers before we were seated in the restaurant where the greatness continued during the menu of twenty different servings with stunning wines paired all the way!   Perfection, perfection, perfection!! Great restaurant!!","50"
"VincyC968","We managed to book a table at Geranium for dinner (ok, we couldn't get a table at Noma), but we're very happy with the whole experience here.  From start to finish it was a perfect night. The atmosphere was more casual than some other fancy restaurants but still very attentive. The dishes are brought out by various waiters as well as some of the chefs which is an excellent idea as can interact with all of them.  We ended up having 24 dishes and paired them with juices. All courses are amazing to look at and so tasty. The juice pairing are perfect with the courses.  The raw asparagus dish is the most elegant dish I've seen ever, so refreshing as an appetizer.   The dish of razor clam is so amazing, even the shell is edible!!  I know I shouldn't be eating that much bread but the butter is the most delicious butter I've ever had in my life, I cannot control myself but keep on eating more bread with more butter, oops.  There are 3 desserts plus 4 more sweets dishes and they all have their own flavours.  Every person is invited to the kitchen to have a course there which is such a unique experience. You can see how the chefs work in there and they're all so efficient.  Overall we enjoyed our night immensely and yes the meal wasn't cheap but it's definitely a great experience. Highly recommend this.","50"
"LauraB593","This was our first visit to Geranium, and what a fantastic gastro experience! We decided to opt for the 4 course tasting lunch accompanied by a number of 'snacks'. The food was beautifully presented by knowledgeable staff and tasted wonderful. Expensive but worth it. The only negative is reaching the restaurant. I'm sure we could have used public transport if we had done a bit of research before but ended up paying for quite an expensive taxi ride. Definitely a wonderful experience.","50"
"DiboTraveller","The Copenhagen food scene is represented well by this pinnacle restaurant. Geranium is expensive, uncompromising and world class. Located on the 8th floor of a football stadium in a beautiful designed space the view if of the parklands and sky, not of stands and the field. The waiters do well to put one at ease and create a friendly ambiance that still puts the food centre stage. Our waiter had a great knowledge of wine (there was no sommelier), and helped us avoid the trendy and often dreadful organic/biodynamic/unfiltered wines that are so prolific in CPH.  The food was wonderful. After the snacks you choose whether you can cope with 10 courses (total) or need 15 to satisfy you. The food is a surprise and handled by the kitchen.  Each dish was fantastic, with no weak points in the menu. The emphasis is on strong natural flavours and presentation that salutes nature, often creating the shallows of the sea, or the floor of a forest on a plate. The charred potatoes and the razor clam dishes stood out as great highlights. We didn’t manage to get to Noma, but many reports, including diners at Geranium say this place is nipping at Noma’s heels.","50"
"davidepX3175MK","Visited here and surprisingly found this spacious restaurant inside the Copenhagen Stadium.

"Waynehicks1966","If you like to spend a small fortune and be pampered with impeccable courteous service, multiple small servings of the finest delicacies the human mind has invented for our palate, this place will serve you one spectacular dining experience that you will remember fondly for a long long time. I compare the presentation and stimulation of all senses to my experience many years ago at Alinea, Chicago before that place sold tickets.","50"
"Gary R","Great dinner for our group, universally voted as the best meal, and Fiskebar and Noma were the tough competition in that contest. Service staff were great, dishses were thoughtful and beautiful presentations. The visit to the kitchen to watch the food being prepared was fun, and it was a remarkably spotless kitchen throughout the evening of preparing at least 50 covers.   Geranium has a great wine list. They have a strong list of beautiful Austrian whites, and you can get completely silly with the selection of Leroy burgundies that they offer.  First place we would book upon returning to Copenhagen. The location is strange when you drive up (back of a football stadium!) but the views once inside are lovely and it is a very comfortable place to dine.","50"
"Anne-Marie V","Everything at Geranium is a work of art.  The food, made with local ingredients, is extremely delicate and subtle both in visual appearance and flavour. The cooks had great vegetarian alternatives to the seafood-based dishes for me. The juice pairing is a lovely idea, with nuances perfectly matching those of the dishes.  The decor is Scandinavian-minimalist and modern, yet charming and cosy. The team is superb: waiters and cooks seem to have a strong personality (I especially loved the slightly cheeky girl who spoke a few words of French with us) yet seem to be a tightly knit team, and this reflects in the way they behave with the customers: they are smiling, professional, and clearly love what they do. It was an absolute pleasure to interact with several of them.  I loved being taken to the kitchen to enjoy one of the dishes, and admiring the cooks (or should I say artists!) at work and chatting to them!  This lunch was a birthday gift from my husband, it was almost a year ago and I am still thinking about it and talking about it to everyone I know. Although I now live very far away from Copenhagen, I do hope I'll get a chance to pay Geranium a second visit some day!","50"
"KCandJC","Wonderful experience but just too expensive and too self important for five stars. I understand ten or 12 courses but 25 is just having a laugh, especially when some are so small that I was half expecting a carved peanut to be placed in front of me. The experience, food, wine, expertise and passion are all wonderful and to be admired. However, sometimes you have to take a breath and check we haven't all gone in tighter and tighter circles until we have no idea why we set-off in the first place. Gardening to make the tea was a good example - looking back, it's easy to see where the five hours went. Visit to the kitchen was a lovely treat.","40"

"Scubie55","We, like many others, had hoped for a visit to NOMA, and were not successful. We searched for an alternative, and found Geranium. I couldn't be happier! The food was divine, and the service was wonderful. Every dish was a piece of art. Every diner is taken to the kitchen for one of the courses, and the different chefs will gather around and chat and take group pictures! What a charming idea. You will likely NOT have a full stomach when you leave, but you will have a memory for your entire life. I would, and hope I do, go again.","50"
"vincentlau","Ambience : Located on the top floor of the stadium, location seems a bit 9dd. But internal decor looks like Per Se in New York. Dark floors, modetn fireplace, expansive windows overlooking a park.  Service : Professional and knowledgeable though a tad slow. Cant compare to the well oiled places like 11 Madison or the french michelljn restaurants. But people were friendly and warm.  Food : We tried the tasting menu. Many snacks and starters. Typical of Danish modern foraging cuisine if only using modern cuisine. But this also limits the creativity of the chefs.   Food were nicely presented as expected of a 3 star michellin restaurant. But it all tasted simple, natural and clean. Not robust. No wow. The main course 9f chicken wing stuffed with other pieces of the chicken breast and mushroom with a nice crispy skin. To be honest, any mom and pop restaurant in Bkk would do a much better version of this traditional stuff chicken wing. Also the cuisine relied too much on local produce like liquorice, yoghurts, elderflower which can be slightly offensive if overdone.  Conclusion : Somehow the whole 3.5hrs dining affair was overtly long and unimpressive. Modern nordic cuisine is a great departure from the 3 traditional star restaurants in France or the robust and creative restaurants in Spain. But it lacked wow.","30"

Everything is done to make sure you are comfortable and happy and special. The waiters and chefs enjoy the performance of food and food so much...amazingly they take you with them in an expereince of amazement...as way and means of creating food and blending food are explored and presented. There is the complicated explanation for some things...and then some wonderful obeject is put before you and presented as 'a burnt potatoe' and yet how ever they burnt that little spud and the custard textured, creamy thingies that went with it...twas amazing. I really cant describe the food and its combinations as that would be too crazy a memory. We decided to do everything the full food and wine combinations, a few wine elements I did not like, but they did their best to change that immediately. and found alternatives....amazing alternatives. we loved it. we spent 3 hours and floated for days...and eveery so often I remember one of the tastes and looks...and I think it will change my own cooking more than most expereinces. If you can get a booking do it. go dont worry about the money. It is indeed expensive. But a unique expereince. worth it in everyway.","50"

They are around you just enough that you never feel you lack something, but they're not too pushy. Just as they should be. And then the food. Boy, it is good. Unlike some restaurants, here you are actually full after the dinner, and all the amazing tastes you have tried.","50"
"marcnesium2000","We had a very pleasant evening at Geranium at the end of April. Every dish of the large menu was extraordinarily tasty and full of ideas, and a vegetarian version(as tasty and perfect as the standard one) was provided too. The focus on local danish and scandinavian ingredients and recipes works perfectly fine and the chef's ability to come up with creative dishes deserves some applause.  What's to be mentioned too, is the very friendly staff. They managed to create a relaxed and comfortable, but still very professional atmosphere, perfectly matching the high quality cuisine.   All in all: what a wonderful evening!  ","50"
"Appelquist","First of all let me say: Geranium is a truly amazing experience (And it has to be with 2 Michelin stars and world's best chef behind the scene). Food is amazing And welcomposed. But 2 Michelin stars and world's best chef statues also means that there shouldn't be any little thing wrong with food or service.  It is small details but when you are in this league it's not okay that I found a little piece of crabshell in one dish and hair in another dish - and its totally not ok when the waiters tells you that you recive a little extra becourse you had that little inconvenience with the food (we thought is was a extraordinary service becourse we didn't complain about shell or hair), when you afterwards finds out, that everyone gets that same little extra...  So when I left Geranium I was partly exited and partly disappointed.","40"
"afzyot","I went for lunch alone and there were only two guests in the entire restaurant.  The universe menu is spectacular. The juice pairing menu has far more interesting combinations than that at noma's, highlight for me is sea bucktorn, gooseberries and sunflower seeds.  The setting is a lot more conservative than noma, but the waitress was friendly and wasn't uptight at all. The price might be a little steep for some, but the number of courses you get is worth the money.","50"
"47peterm47","We had the ""Universe"" menu here at lunch. Nearly every dish was wow. It was well balanced. Interesting and innovative but for flavour or taste and not just for the sake of it. The wine list was extensive and we were guided well. The other thing that made it for me as a couple was the ability to buy great glasses of wine by the 5 or 10cl using their Coravin technology (cork left in and air replaced with Argon). Every table was invited into the Kitchen Table for a course which was fantastic as it had an amazing air of calm and professionalism. Some dishes were genius in their conception like the onion and cheese broth or the lamb and pine cones but all were inspired. This ranks as one of the best meals of my life and yet was clearly Danish and not just another international menu. The spacing of the tables was so generous and lovely views over the gardens and into the Kitchen.","50"
"Globe99trotter","After not having managed to get a table at Noma, my friend and I decided pretty spontaneously to go to Geranium for my birthday.  We went for the small tasting menu with matching wines (5 glasses one of which was actually an apple juice with camomile).   I arrived on time, but had to wait for my friend who came directly from the airport. Welcome and service while waiting was very friendly and continued to be like that throughout the afternoon. We were served 8 snacks that were incredibly creative, beautifully arranged and exquisite in taste. The signature dishes were following in the footsteps of those appetisers.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is a perfect mix between style and class without being stiff. The service is attentive without being in your face all the time and they even manage to react to jokes without feeling intimidated. The 5 small sweets were too adventurous to our liking, when they should have really worked for us as neither of us has a sweet tooth. But the onion in the onion and plum caramel was just a bit too strong. Only slight criticism on the way the menu is written/sold:  To include tiny breads and butter as one of four signature dishes (aka main courses) and a glass of juice as one of the 5 glasses of wine when asking for 1200 Dkk for the food and 900 Dkk for the wine (matching juices would have been 300 Dkk) is a wee bit cheeky.  Luckily we had a very generous waiter who managed to not let this fact spoil the fantastic experience. We both agreed in the end that the experience at Noma would probably not have been as good as at Geranium!","50"
"Mati560","This was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Not only was the food wonderful but the interactions between staff and diners added to the experience. All guests are invited into the kitchen and to interact with the staff. The food itself was excellently prepared and the timing of dishes perfect. You can buy their wine pairings or select a bottle. Here too the sommelier was helpful and patient. Snag a reservation if u can, it is a treat.","50"
"tbonezz1","My wife and I tried this place the day after we went to Noma and quite a different experience. However, their interaction with their guests are second to none as well as their course presentations. As each dish came to the table, acual chefs brought your food and explained the dishes. How great is that! The presentation of these dishes were mere artwork, which makes it that much more exciting. So much talent in that kitchen. Each and everyone can open their own restaurants successfully. As beautiful each course was plated, the taste was phenomenal! One course, they brought us into their kitchen and sat us down with three bocus d' Or trophies on the table and we were able to see the magic that occurs each service and impeccable cleanliness of the kitchen. It looks like a large kitchen of someone's house! All in all a wonderful culinary experience! I really hope this establishment ranks in the top 20 in the world's best this year.","50"
"Jiten P","Went to Geranium on April 22nd, the night after we went to Noma(review coming shortly). So you can see that they had their work cut out for them. But when you go to such places you understand why they are considered some of the best culinary establishments in the world. We chose the full Universe menu with the wine pairing and it did not disappoint. From the freshest ingredients, mainly vegetables and seafood, the preparation and the excellent service Geranium it definitely deserves to be one of the best dining establishments in the world. If you are a foodie and will appreciate the concept and food please do try and visit this place. We were lucky to get reservations at Noma and Geranium one night after the other.","50"
"Michael G","Great food. Excellent service. The chef himself very actively involved in the client interaction. There is passion and world class culinary performance. Only point to wish for would be an equally top class ambiance and a more cozy room.","50"
"Happi_Belly","Visited the restaurant twice during my visit to Copenhagen!!! Both their tasting menu and the vegetarian menu is epic. Service and atmosphere are both top notch too. A MUST visit restaurant if you are in Copenhagen!!!","50"
"Lonech","We choose the ""small"" serving menu , I had the Juice menu and my husband the wine menu. Everything was prepared to perfection. A lot of ""appetizer"" was served, and the creativity was at a very high leavel. The main dishes just tasted sublime, and the dessert was one of the best we have ever tasted. Waiters very friendly and relaxed and a stunning vue over ""Fælledparken"". Remember to get coffee before you leave, the avecs are small masterpieces","50"
"JokkeDeFrib","We have eaten in many nice restaurants around the world, and in CPH Noma to mention one. But what i experienced in Geranium was for me something very special. From the cool relaxed atmosphere, to the kitchen visit. Everything was just so perfectly executed. I cam expecting nothing, and left with a feeling that this is now my second best dining experience of all time. To top it off even our 3 year old daughter loved all the dishes. What a treat, I think this restaurant is Denmark's best bet ever for a 3'rd Michelin star. Wow just Wow sums it up.","50"
"e178511","Ok, so while the food was EXCELLENT, female waitstaff made an ignorant and fatal error. When the woman at the table asks for suggestions on where to go in Copenhagen, it is profoundly poor judgment for the female wait staff to respond to the male at the table and give him the check when the woman is clearly paying. Sad that the culinary experience is trumped by waitstaff stupidity. Will not be returning and suggest same to others.","10"
"47LouiseC","Dining at Geranium is much more than just a meal. It is a unique experience where food meets art. Every dish is an example of incredible craftsmanship. The invitation into the kitchen to meet the chefs and watch the dishes being created is the icing on the cake. Highly recommended for a special occasion.","50"
"Avi8tion","Let me start with a warning note: Only consider going there if you can answer two questions with yes: 1. Do you like the craftsmanship of cooking at its extreme high level with an outstanding attention to detail, innovation and creativity? 2. Are you prepared to spend the resulting sum of money to be priveliged to enjoy what is listed under #1 above? If you can say yes to both, you are in for a culinary journey that will take you into a different world in terms of taste, creativity, perfection and presentation. It would be inadequate to say more than that. If the 2 points above are answered with a no, do not go there, or it will hurt badly :-)","50"
"mlb1310","the best restaurant in Copenhagen in my opinion. We chose it over Noma and it lived up to our high expectations","50"
"Frederik J","This was a very unique experience. The food was the most visually stunning I have ever experienced and every plate was a work of art. It is as much a visual experience as it is a tasting experience. The service is amazing! All in all a very unique experience and definitely worth it if you can afford as it is extremely expensive.","50"
"daedus","My lunch with a friend was exquisite; the presentation was an exercise in elegance and a clear attempt to pursue some form of perfection. The atmosphere was so serene it almost hinted at a layer of sterility, but the view overlooking the park and the quick serving of dishes prevented too much musing on this. The young staff seemed to reverently serve and follow up each small dish with a curt nod and description that helped map out the experience. The open kitchen was fascinating to behold; the weapon of choice in seemed to be tweezers, picking in fine technique at the blades of herbs and various nordic vegetables. The food was tasty and complex. The mix of salt and sour and sweet with the textures that opened the mind to a quiet cacophony of impressions I have often applied at other fine dining spots. We had the juice pairing, which was sublime. Fresh seabuck thorn juice was clearly the rockstar of the five, but the other four were perfect companions. The only negative to the experience was speed at which we sailed through the 17 dishes (we chose the smaller, rather than the univers menu with 21) at such a constant velocity that I have trouble recalling the specific plates. The culinary details have since melted together. Dessert on the other hand, was served in the kitchen and provided an unique opportunity to chat with the sous-chef and view the operation--a most impressive one at that. All in all a special and tasty experience I would recommend if shelling out a couple of thousand kroner isn't a problem.","40"
"Inge B","Great food...nice cook .....but not the most exciting entrance ...but indoor it is ok! And have a nice view!!!","50"
"bol314","IF you like good food, and have some hours or 5, you must, you simply MUST visit Geranium. The service is great, the food is the best in the world (og amongst my 5 best dinner expreiences ever) and the wine is the prefect match. Go there for a thrill of your life. The chefs experiment with food in a way, you have to see, even the small beradpieces are a thrill. The beauty goes hand in hand with the naturalness and flowers in the food, the presentation - that always has a lot extra - and the ambeince is just among the bset, not only in Denmark, but in the world.","50"
"siannie263","Amazing experience.  We had the Univers menu 21 courses. No faults whatsoever. A perfect break in betwen each course. Every course was carefully prepared in great detail by very talented chefs. The waiting staff were all very friendly and the service was impeccable they all had excellent knowledge of Geranium, the food and the wine. You can tell they are very passionate and well trained.  All I can say is delicious!!","50"
"TheGlobalGrownUp","The food is unique - I have never had anything as delicate and interesting at any restaurant before.  The service is equally unique - we were made welcome to the point of becoming friends with this amazing bunch of young food artists and experts.  Only slight negative - the wine suggested with the food was too ""Northern European"" - too many German wines - but we should just have chosen a good French wine ourselves. Just a matter of taste.  In sum, an amazing evening in the company of a fantastic bunch of people.  Wow.","50"
"Torben_Lyst","I LOVE:  The place !   The spacious dining room where you get a HUGE table (do ask for Table One !) even though you are just a company of two.   The distance between the tables actually allow private conversations.  The white table cloths.  That you can opt to sit - actually both of you - in the ""couch"" at the (window) tables and not in less confortable chairs.  I love that you NEVER EVER have to do any efforts to get the attention of a waiter. They seem to be around in a flash whenever you need them - but when you don't need them, they're invisible (how do they do that??).  I love the pretentious presentations: They're serving art. However, in respect of many servings the art is taking up 99 % of the plate and the food for you to eat is the remaining 1 %.  I MISS:  Second time I dined at Geranium (both times were in November 2014) I went to have two hotdogs in downtown Copenhagen because one thing the session with Geranium is not likely to do, is satisfying a hungry stommach:  Go to Geranium with the expectation that you will leave full (or even with a semi-full stommach) and you'll be greatly dissapointed: Actually, as soon as you've left Geranium, you'll start wondering where to go to actually EAT.  Geranium is (for me) a spectacular ""theatre"" (in the most positive way): There is NO WHERE ELSE in Copenhagen with such a spectacular dining room. The view is NOT nearly as great as the view from your table at Alberto K - but NO other dining room compares to Geranium.  You're right in the middle of this ""theatre"" where they'll treat you with SMALL servings of ART - and the matching wine menu will make you dizzy in the most pleasant way.   If the purpose of your visit is to settle your basic hunger, then you'll be crying when they introduce the ""mandatory"" DKK 8,000 (EUR 1,000) bill.  But if you go there to enjoy the show, you won't be dissapointed. AT ALL.","50"
"Alex L","Myself and a friend went here for a meal as we are both foodies and had not had any Michelin-starred before. The welcome was great and the setting brilliant. The layout was stylish also. Had the universe menu which was 21 courses including starters and the food was amazing. Such a variety and all so fresh. The most important thing was the staff-they were so friendly, were obviously proud of the food and enjoyed themselves. It was really special and won't forget it. Thanks","50"
"ChRubin","As a New York City ""foodie"" - take my word for it - this will be one of the best dining experiences of your life. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed. The staff is both friendly and professional. The food is amazingly prepared - each dish is a work of art that is delicious. A fantastic 4 hour experience - expensive but worth it!","50"
"Peter J","In my opinion - and I have experienced the kitchen in all Copenhagen Michelin-star restaurants, this two-Michelin star restaurant has truly deserved its stars.  I much prefer it over Noma, because the elegance of the meals, the challenges to your taste buds and simply the superb taste are in Geranium's focus whereas I find Noma very engaged in being strange just for being strange.","50"
"RaymondL23","We were being greeted warmly once we arrived. The service was friendly throughout the 3 hour dinner journey. The food presentation was excellent and out of expectation though not all dishes were tasty. The food portion was small, so be prepared for a late night snack if you are a big eater.  The staff were also very helpful. They recommended us a few top quality restaurants in Oslo when knowing that we were about to visit Oslo after Copenhagen. Those recommendations were great.  It was definitely an interesting experience.","50"
"Sral2214","Did the Universe Tasting Menu with the wine pairing, which was great. The food was creative, tasty and aesthetically impeccable. The staff did a fine job explaining the various courses, and the timing was (substantially) good. You also get to visit the kitchen and talk to the chefs, which was a positive experience. Recommended!","50"
"bragem","I went here with my family for a luxurious dinner, and it was fabulous! The waiters couldn't have been better, and the food was extraordinary! It's my first time going to a restaurant this good, and I loved it! Its the best food and the best experience I have had in my foodworld!","50"
"Mikrobloed","Writing a review of Geranium as an amateur foodie is hard. How does one explain exactly what a 2 Michelin starred restaurant owned and run by a chef who has participated 3 times in Bocuse d’or and won Gold, Bronze and Silver?  I was lucky enough to go there with 2 friends who love good food and appreciate the masterful handiwork of the chef’s behind the dishes as much as I do and it was a fantastic experience. 26 dishes accompanied by perfectly matched wine, followed by petit fours, coffee and amazing Grappa picked by our waiter.  Each dish a small picture of perfection with flavor that teases your palate and makes you wonder how on earth they come up with the ideas.  What was best? I don’t know… I could happily sit and eat a whole platter of the 'Charred Potato' served on the smoked sheep milk butter or the edible 'Seaweed and Razor clam' impressions of the ocean – a Clam tartar in edible shells.  I am still mystified by the see through clear jellied ham which together with tomato water, aromatic herbs and sorrel flowers provided a small heavenly dish.  Or the salted Hake with buttermilk, caviar, herb stems and crisped hake scales. The amazing small duck sausage served with berry ‘ketchup’ and the desserts… Blackberries with hip rose tea and bees wax ice cream, 'The taste of naked tree' made of frozen dark beer, prunes and cream with beech wood…  And I must mention the amazing champagne and wine menu perfectly matched to the dishes.  The staff was friendly and extremely professional. Our waiter not only was a trained waiter but also a chef and weeks away from becoming a sommelier. He could answer almost all questions on how the dishes had be prepared and for the two he couldn’t he went and got the chef who had prepared it to explain to us even arranging for one of them to come and answer all our remaining questions while we had coffee in the lounge area.  Everyone should treat themselves to this kind of experience at least once in their lifetime (I hope to do so more often).","50"
"ChrTF","It is truly a unique experience to dine at Geranium. Every dish is a masterpiece, the aromas and tastes are intense and the visual presentations are amazing. The service is excellent, yet informal which we prefer. Unfortunately they didn't have our first choice of wine which should have been marked on the wine list.  An evening at Geranium is expensive - but try it.","50"
"Vicky R","........Between going to Noma and eating at Geranium.... go to Germanium, you won't be disappointed.","50"
"MatthewJ958","From the moment you enter this restaurant you are taken on an unforgettable journey- everything has been thought through in minute detail. We had the full tasting menu- I had the juice paring- something I've never experienced before The flavours are natural and simple, a fusion of nature and ultra modern cuisine. It's a once in a lifetime thing that I will never forget. £300 a head- but worth every penny. It's much more than a meal in a restaurant, it's a 'life experience' Team Geranium- you are doing something exceptional and totally original.","50"
"trailofcrumbs15","We went for the second time after two years. Blown away by the beauty with substance. The technique, precision, service, balance of flavours, execution.. faultless. This time the desserts stole the show. Dining at Geranium makes me feel special. It's my favourite restaurant in Copenhagen, and one of my top 5 in the world (that I've visited of course)!","50"
"Camila F","My husband and I visited the restaurant on our lay day in Copenhagen.  The restaurant is indeed nice and clean, but we were not impressed by the food and wine.  The food is very interesting as we had never tried molecular gastronomy, but some of the dishes are just ok. The wines served with wine pairing were nothing special and they didn't refill our glasses (1 small glass every 3-4 courses). In the end, we felt that we were just eating some interesting snacks for 2 hours. You can definitely find better places for that money.","20"
"marthursson","We came with the highest of expectations and they were completely fulfilled. This is not a meal, it's an experience for all senses. 20 courses and everything was perfect to the last detail - wonderful taste, artistic presentation and fantastic service.  After the 4,5 hours we were full, exhausted from all the sensory input and very, very happy with the evening.","50"
"Dana N","My husband and I had an exceptional lunch at Geranium recently to celebrate an anniversary. It really was an amazing experience. We had the smaller of the two degustation menus, (there is no a la carte option) which was ideal for us. Around 15 dishes and ""snacks"", all of which were delicious and exquisitely presented. We couldn't help photographing many of them as they just looked so incredible, particularly the ""razor clams"" and ""dill stones"".   There is an option to eat one of the dishes in the kitchen if you like. We loved this, and haven't experienced it anywhere before. It was fascinating to see the precision work of the chefs.  I'd recommend lunch rather than dinner to take advantage of the lovely view of outer Copenhagen.","50"
"W5429IIdavidh","Didn't know what to expect with Geranium - I kinda thought it was a poor man's Noma (not having ever been). It totally blew me away.   Went there for my wife's 40th birthday. Incredibly inventive dishes. We went for lunch and had the larger tasting menu. Each dish was small, but the flavors were both subtle and potent (when it needed to be). I know chefs in Copenhagen are now foraging for everything now - the flavors I had were totally new and exciting. The presentation was out of this world. All were mini pieces of art.   Some of the notable dishes: scallop stones, mushroom soup, and the bread.   The service was exceptional. The price was a little excessive, but given the quality, service and setting probably fair.   If price is not an issue, I highly recommend.  ","40"
"321Bill123","My wife and I enjoyed a leisurely lunch at Geranium after not being able to obtain a rez at Noma. Quite simply we had the best dining experience we have ever had and........ we have eaten at many of the top rated Michelin 3 stars in the world. Dining to us is the entire experience, from walking in the front door, to being ushered out of the restaurant. Geranium nailed it!! The staff was welcoming and extremely helpful; each dish was picture-worthy and delicious; the flavours were unique and perfectly developed; and the entire staff bent over backward to ensure that we dined at our pace and understood what we were eating. One course was served at a chef's table in the kitchen and almost every chef visited our table during the marathon dining experience. We had an opportunity to visit with other diners and each and every one was thrilled with their experience. We would love to find a better restaurant but, I cannot imagine how one could exist. One word.................perfect! Oops.........two words............perfect..............and...............expensive ;-) But....worth every penny!!!","50"
"einar e","Great food, more than 20 ""dishes"". Short visit to the Kitchen (not necessary). We aksed for another table, but got a Third one, while People coming later were allowed to change to the table we wanted.","40"
"FrancisDy","If I were to wrap up the ""universe experience"" in one sentence it would be:  Beautiful [semi]-edible works of art inspired by Rasmus' experiences and notions of Denmark, let down by the front of house and awkward pacing. As many people have mentioned the presentation was stunning, however not every course provided the wow-factor while eating.  Pros: -Getting to sit in the kitchen and watch a symphony enfold in front of your eyes. We were able to take as many pictures as we wanted, and the entire kitchen staff insisted in stopping their meal prep to take a group pictures with us.   -Amazingly friendly chefs who were willing to converse both in the kitchen, and table-side. The chefs are truly passionate about their work and of Rasmus. So much so, that one chef spent quite some time discussing his past cooking at the French Laundry and the new-found inspiration he has at Geranium.  -Beautiful presentation, and a unique perspective on Scandinavian food.  Cons: -Inattentive waitstaff. At times a chef would come out with a tray of food, and have to wait for assistance to present the course at the table. For us, after finishing our penultimate course we were provided a keepsake menu. Unbeknownst to us, the final ""course"" was a mini box of bonbons obtained while paying. This would have been fine if the check was provided with the keepsake menu. However, we spent the next hour wondering where the last course was, and more importantly where a server was. Once we finally flagged down a server, he seemed somewhat fazed that he brought us the menus without the bill.  -Lacking coordination between front of house and back of house. After finishing a course, a gentleman in the table next to us stood up to use the restroom. Rather than waiting for him to return, food came out and was placed on the table while he was still away. Which unfortunately made him miss the presentation and final dressings that each plate obtained, as well as allowed for food to be eaten past it's prime.  -Awkward pacing. This could be attributed to a lack of coordination, but following the appetizer rounds, the main courses appeared at random intervals. One main course came out 30 minutes after the prior main course, while the following course arrived immediately after the table was cleaned.  Overall, the food, creativity and EXCEPTIONAL tweezer use was great. But as an experience as a whole, it is definitely still lacking. At the price point of 1600DKK I've definitely had better all around experiences. But if you happen to be in Copenhagen, want a delicious meal for your eyes and your stomach, AND you'll be willing to take 5 hours out of your day (depending on wait staff) you should definitely try Geranium.  On a side note to many finer establishments, if you're paying $300+ pp a meal why is coffee and tea still extra?!?","30"
"LarsBA","Well, naming a reastaurant in the same city as Noma, the world no. one, as the best, take a lot of nerve. OK, you go to Noma to be challenges and its innovation level is unmatched. But you go to Geranium for a innovative, but less challenging experience. The food and wine is top notch, no error whatsoever could be detected during 4½ hours meal.  The service level is unmatched, I spent quite some time just to watch the team on the floor, everyone was exactly where and when needed with no visible communication, never intruding, just magically turning up where needed and disapering again - magic!","50"
"foodie007","The presentation of each of the 21 plates of the Universal tasting menu were stunning. The taste of each dish was consistently thoughtfully executed, harmonious, well-balanced, and downright delicuous. While they may appear superfluous at other restaurants, foraged items and molecular gastronomy were delicately used to enhance some dishes with special care taken to keep taste at the forefront. Even the bread is well thought out. The rolls are small and brought to the table in the middle of the meal. This is especially important for someone like me who can make a meal out of the bread, not leaving enough room for the actual food. With each dish, it was apparent why Rasmus Kofoed won Bocuse d'Or.  Soren Ledet, an accomplished chef and sommelier, also serves as Head of House. There is a clear commitment to all components of the dining experience. Geranium is known to have one of the best wine pairings. Recognizing that not everyone drinks, yet wanting to offer each diner an enhanced experience, he speaks about the juice pairing with the passion of a sommelier about wine, making me feel less apologetic about not being an wine connoisseur. It's impossible to compare Noma and Geranium, but the juice pairing is one are that could be compared. The one at Geranium is better developed and well thought out.  The dining room is stylish and thoughtfully designed. Cooking is done behind the scene, but the visible kitchen allows patrons to watch while their dishes are being plated. I can’t help but think that the kitchen was designed to serve as a culinary theatre.   Bottom line: I ate at both Geranium and Noma this trip. I want to quit my job and work for free at Noma to be a part of that energy and see where the future of food is headed, but I would return and share a perfect meal with someone I love or want to impress at Geranium!","50"
"Marco v","I have visited for the second time now, for lunch this time, but the lunch and dinner menus are the same. Obviously I enjoyed my first visit, and I was very impressed again. One of the very best restaurants in Northern Europe, easily. Located rather unusually on the top level of a large sports stadium, it has great views over the neighbouring park. Some of the dishes were the same as during my previous visit, both times consistently perfectionistic. The food/wine combinations are the best I have enjoyed in Copenhagen. It is also an experience to have one of the smaller dishes in the kitchen, behind Rasmus Koefoed's Bocuse awards, overlooking all the activities.","50"
"Shero J","Definitely great place, delicious food with great sea taste and soups, service is very comfortable until you leave there","50"
"Kykykykong","We originally wanted to try Noma when we were planning our trip to Copenhagen. It was fully booked, of course. My friend then recommended Geranium and told me it was amazing. She was absolutely right! Excellent service, view (facing a huge park), atmosphere, decor and creative dishes. It's one of my top five favourite restaurants. P.s. we didn't try their amazing wines. Next time :)","50"
"peredo","A damp lunchtime in Copenhagen was perfect for enjoying three hours of sybaritic gourmandise. Stifle your squeals of horror at the prices; in fact, after deciding to forget about how much it was all costing, the meal at Geranium felt great value for a special occasion. Sure, the best part of £500 for two (including tip, which we weren't sure was de rigueur or not in Denmark but was definitely merited) is a lot, but when it's for a meal as sumptuous and perfect as this was, it compares well to, say, going to a cup final or expensive seats at the opera. Set against other restaurants in the city (we couldn't get into Noma, but tried several joints run by ex-Noma chefs - none cheap), Geranium blew the socks off anything else we experienced. There's a lot of fancy but disappointingly untasty cooking going on: new wave, new clothes-ish. By contrast, every morsel produced by Rasmus and his international team sent tastebuds zinging and marvelling (read other reviews for details). Each dish is a work of art, too. Incredible attention to detail and obvious love of ingredients mark out an exceptional kitchen - open for all to see (and experience while eating one of the multitude of dishes). All this was matched by a relaxed and attractive dining room, and a charming, knowledgeable and properly attentive waiting staff. Definitely one of the best meals ever.","50"
"Ihearttravellin... t","Our first fine dinning experience and it was more than we could have expected. Fabulous setting with ample room. The food experience was indescribable, really incredible experience for your palate. The service was welcoming and friendly and in no way pretentious. The wine and champagne was formidable. We felt very privileged to meet Rasmus, the Head Chef and being invited into the kitchen was a cherry on the top. The dessert was the best I have ever sampled. I really recommend this restaurant and it will always remain as one of the most unique eating experiences of my life.","50"
"Willie C","Located at 8th Floor, it offers a panoramic view of the park.  Comes with juice and wine pairing.  The full 22 course will take 3 hours so come prepared.  One course involved going into the kitchen which turned out to be fun.  A definite must try.","50"
"asma s","The food and service at Geranium was nothing short of fantastic. The Head Chef presented us with two courses, we were invited into the kitchen to eat one of our courses and the hospitality was just fantastic. Let's talk food....Geranium is able to infuse gastronomy with flavours that do not confuse your palette. Having also eaten at Noma, one of the things I enjoyed most about Geranium is that i had an opportunity to taste new flavours combined/infused with known favourites. Everything was fantastic..I highly recommend!","50"
"cleoSydney_aus","Went there for dinner on our return from a cruise on our 3rd day in Copenhagen. What a great decision. The food was delicious , the tastes went together so well, but the highlight was they way everything was served, in a fabulous artistic way.We even had a course in the kitchen looking at the chefs preparing the food and admiring their statue awards. The staff were excellent in their very professional and frendly service and we felt very relaxed in our surroundings. It is an experience when in Copenhagen not to be missed.","50"
"Ben B","I recently had the pleasure of visiting Geranium. The meal was certainly something special that will stand out in my memory. The cuisine is inventive and the atmosphere, elegant. The staff were casual but professional -- something I appreciated. Overall, it was a wonderful time. The next day, however, I felt a little hungover because of the large amount of food and the exotic ingredients. I recommend dining here (or Restaurant Noma) while in Copenhagen.","40"
"Martine A","Based on the reviews and its 2 m stars, I expected... something more? Certainly the food was good and the presentation very appealing, but it didn't stand out at all from other fine dining - except in price. I know this this Denmark, but still, the prices were astronomical and I left still feeling hungry. The juices were... mediocre. I enjoyed the chance to eat one course in the kitchen, but aside from that nothing really stood out to me about this place. We were left baffled at how highly it was praised. Keep in mind lunch can easily set you back $700 (without wine). Was this simply a one off? Or perhaps a case of the emperors new clothes....","30"
"PS517","We opted for the universal menu for lunch without a drink pairing (I had champagne and my friend had a red). While pricy, every dollar was worth it. Each plate is presented as a piece of art. The food was an amazing combination of flavor and texture. I have never experienced anything like it. The staff was warm and welcoming -- I have been to other Michelin star restaurants and have never experienced such professional yet not snobby service. One of our servers, Julie, went out of her way to put together a list of places for us to check out in Copenhagen and Malmo. I would highly recommend Geranium to anyone who is going to Copenhagen and has a love for food.","50"
"FidelmaMcMorrow","I could go on and on about this place. It is VERY expensive but worth every little penny. The food is amazing and the service is phenomenal. Its a food experience for a lifetime.

"KMaeL","On Sept 20, 2014, I had a 3 hour lunch at Restaurant Geranium. Although this was only my first day there, I had no doubt that it was going to be the highlight of my trip to Copenhagen! #42 best in the world with 2 Michelin stars - well deserved and earned! I could see and feel the care that was taken to ensure that every individual course was delicious and beautiful! The chefs and the staff are #1 in my eyes! I was even invited to sit in the kitchen when served one of the 4 dessert courses of my 22 course universe tasting menu! I dined alone that day but I never felt it. Likewise, how incredibly gracious of the chefs to agree to take a photo with me - in the kitchen, seated (where I had eaten my dessert) beside Chef Kofoed's Bocuse d'Or awards, with his entire kitchen staff! I can't say enough about how wonderful my experience was! Thank you Chef Kofoed and thank you everyone (of the names I remember - Mikael, Tatiana, Will, Ben, and Paul) from Restaurant Geranium!","50"
"DrSusan2013","We chose to begin our introduction to Denmark with dinner at Geranium based upon a recommendation from a friend.

"manuerod","I had the Universe of taste menu with wine pairing and it has probably been one of my best food experiences, which coming from Spain, a country with several restaurants between the top best is quite a lot to say. The opportunity of having a serving (the ""beach fantasy"" of the razor clams in the kitchen was really special. The service impeccable, the place and views incredible (once overcome the surprise of finding it in the National Stadium) and the food full of imagination and flavor but at the same time very respectful with the natural ingredients. If you can afford the money it is certainly a must in Copehagen's outstanding food scene.","50"
"T D","Run by head chef Rasmus Kofoed, who took both 1st, 2nd and 3rd place at the Ballon D'or, this place has something to live up to. And it does. The restaurant is very stilish decorated, waiters and sommeliers top professional and the food is innovative and experimenting, but not ""too experimenting"". The tasts being delivered from the kitchen are amazing and the combinations are astonishing. Wines are excellent and the service formel but not cold.  It will set you back a bit, but if you don't mind spending a little extra, this is one of the top places to go for in Europe for that ""little extra"".","50"

"matiasrake","Being a regular visitor to Copenhagen and having triend among others Noma and Kadeau, I've been wanting to visit Geranium for a long time. I finally got the chance this september along with som friends from university.  From the very beginning we were taken good care of. Our waiter (Norwegian!) was attentive and relaxed, knowledeable and all in all a steady hand through our meal along with the rest of the staff.  To list every dish would be impossible, but it's safe to say it's one of the best I've ever experienced. One might tire a bit from the strict adherence to Nordic ingredients, but the team at Kadeau managed to turn out one dish better than the other. I wa sespecially impressed with the technical level involved in some of the dishes, Mr. Kofoed surely sets the bare high, and never misses.  The meal is pricey (around 3000 DKK+tip per person), so this is not the resturant you visit unless you're interested in dining on the highest level. Some of the other diners missed protein, but to me that was not an issue.  We left Geranium with licorice ""bolsjer"" (candy), being guided to a cocktail bar by our waiter happy and veru satisfied.","50"
"Jenfoo77","Dining is not just about food....it's the overall experience! And I had it all at the Geranium ! Every dish including snacks was prepared so exquisitely and served exclusively. I enjoyed the experience of being served in the kitchen too..the 4 hour dinner is amazing and an experience I will never forget...","50"
"Robert K","The food was absolutely fantastic with a 23 course inventive meal served by the best staff ever. I think there were more employees that patrons on this full night. The location with a great Copenhagen view was superb. The only caveat is that with wine pairings it was the most expensive dinner I have ever had, but it was absolutely worth it for this 1 seating restaurant.","50"
"annak1973","I have booked this restaurant more than a week ago,ready for Xmas Eve as we are going to Copenhagen for Xmas to see Tivoli . Today I was sent short email: ''You reservations have been canceled. (ID # : 27210) We look forward to welcoming you another time.'' No apology no explanation. How disappointing! Had booking made also for Radio restaurant that turned out to be closed too , but I received an email a couple of days after explaining that they were closed-and there was a network error fair enough.Can happen - at least I was treated professionally. If service in Geranium equals communication then I won't bother to visit.","10"
"JeffMCalgary","Had an incredible experience here. Every course was a work of art and a culinary adventure. The staff were professional and personable. Our experience here was probably even better than our meal at noma later in the week. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a foodie travelling to Copenhagen.","50"
"T34_M","Awesome food and very good service. The waiter helped me select what I wanted and everything was delicious. A very nice place for dinner.","50"
"Ice_Zombie84","This was for the best dining experience in my life (and I have been to Frantzen and Steirereck). Although the experience were different, I enjoyed my time and food in Geranium more. Easily booked through their online booking site. I liked that they informed me (by email one day before) if I had any allergies to any foods. Being a muslim, I do not eat any pork products or alcoholic beverages. They accommodated my request without having to remind them.   The service was excellent. They food presentation and taste was all more than I had expected and even better. We loved the kitchen visit.   The only downside I would say is that the price is a bit high but my enjoyment far outweighs the price.","50"
"Yukari K","We had an excellent meal, one of the few experiences we've had that came close to Alinea in Chicago, which we consider to be the gold standard in food and service.   We particularly appreciated the little touches of service -- occasional courses served by one of the chefs, a non-alcoholic pairing menu, and a visit inside the kitchen to taste a course and take photos with the chefs. It was abundantly clear that they were there for the diners, not the other way around which is sometimes the case with restaurants in this class.   It's not cheap, but it was a memorable experience.","50"
"170glennt","We celebrated a birthday at Geranium, and it was mind blowing.   Everything from the staff to the food and the ambient atmosphere was out of the ordinary.  By the time we had finished the food adventure, both our stomachs and mind was full....  There can't be that big difference between Geranium and Noma, besides the fact, that Geranium is available on a much shorter notice.   Enjoy, Rasmus and staff created magic for us, and I can only encourage other people to give it a go.","50"
"Chips10","Geranium is a truly memorable experience. Admittedly it is in a slightly odd location at the top of a sports ground but the restaurant is absolutely beautiful with the kitchen on full show, the tables well spaced and the whole restaurant beautifully done. The food has some extraordinary highs and some mediocre ones. From the 27 dishes we ate, we experienced some tastes and food we'd never had before and all the dishes are presented as pieces of art. We opted not to have the matching wine pairings which was very expensive but we had a wonderful bottle of white Burgundy and it certainly kept us going through the menu. The highlight is being taken into the kitchen, meet the chefs and get to experience the kitchen. Overall, it is a highly memorable experience with some knockout food. We are in Kokkeriet the night after and felt the food there was a touch better but in terms of overall experience (4 hours) Geranium is spectacular.","50"
"rossn608","Recommended to us by a local as we were unable to get into Noma which had been voted world no.1. Anyway, located on the top floor of the stadium complex with nice views out to the coast. The menu is sort of molecular gastronomic with no ability to order. You get given what they decide to serve you. Not that cheap but worth the experience. We did not select the wine pairings that can be chosen to go with the menu but the wine list was pretty extensive and we found a nice Alsace wine that went well with the menu.","40"
"Ken K","Absolutely outstanding cuisine, service, and experience. The food was as good as any I have enjoyed, anywhere in the world. The service was exceptionally attentive without being intrusive. Management, prep, and front of house were integrated seamlessly to produce a dining experience that should be enjoyed by all who want a world class dining experience. I asked many questions, and all were answered cheerfully and with enthusiasm. The food, wine and juice combinations played well on local, regional, and international ingredients and produced some truly unbelievable flavors and sensations. Go to Copenhagen, and don't miss Geranium! Definitely going back for another fabulous experience.","50"
"jlb3","A restaurant that would be world-class anywhere in Europe or indeed the world, Geranium was simply phenomenal, deserving of accolades among the very top restaurants in Denmark and indeed in the world. My wife and I have eaten at the finest restaurants in many of the major European capitals as well as in most of the major U.S. cities, and Geranium will now occupy a spot as one of the most memorable meals of my life. Not quite as aggressive on the ""foraging"" front as that best-known Danish restaurant, Geranium balances the whimsical with the delicious, ensuring that its elaborate presentations and wink-wink concepts don't overcome the basic mandate that food should have excellent taste.   We came for the full-fourse lunch with wine pairings, which for two comes in at just around USD$1000. I consider this a more than reasonable tariff considering comparable prices for three-Michelin star restaurants in Paris, London or New York. The pairings are inventive, well-chosen selections from small vineyards, and their careful selection added considerably to our enjoyment of the meal. Juice pairings are also available. If the one juice included in our pairings was any guide, you aren't missing out by choosing that option -- they are delicious.  The restaurant seems to be a bit hard for people to find -- indeed, it's an office building just off of a park in a somewhat nondescript area -- but I have to assume that if you can afford to dine here, you can probably afford a smartphone with GPS. I had no difficulty walking there using that method.","50"
"DVyas24","Dinner at Geranium was disappointing due to low energy and outdated decor. The location is the main football stadium with an average view. Considering the price of the meal this place needs a major update to stay relevant in the Copenhagen food scene.  While the food was quite creative the overall ambiance certainly did not deserve a #2 ranking for Copenhagen. The service was hurried and lacked energy except when one of the assistant chef's stopped by. The building entrance was not clean and lift and lobby of the restaurant needs to be cleaned up, For the price of the meal here we would expect an overall experience and not just some creative dishes.","30"
"NKKOman","We were 7 of us celebrating our son's 11th birthday. Three of our group were vegiterrian. The restaurant prepared us a 22 course menu !! Even for the vegiterrians !!! We were floored by the service and the food was absolutely amazing. Definitely the best we have had so far... they even gave my son an amazing surprise. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Copenhagen.","50"
"Brian R","My wife and I have dined at some wonderful restaurants in different parts of the world, but our dining experience at Geranium is the best we have had. We went for lunch and there is a choice of two or three hour menus. We had the three hour extravaganza on the basis this was a once off experience. I also had the wine accompaniment. In statistical terms we had 9 taste starters, followed by 13 dishes, bread and butter and a Bonbon on leaving. Everyone of these was a taste sensation. I also had 8 different wines and apple juice infused with Chamomile. My wife had an endless supply of sparkling water. The serving and presentation of each dish is a theatrical experience performed by the very friendly staff who explain each dish which in every case is visually stunning and exciting in taste. The wines are carefully selected to provide ideal support for the food. Towards the end you are invited into the plating area of the kitchen and have an opportunity to discuss with one of the chefs. At all times you are made to feel most welcome, and there is a seamless delivery of dishes and serving of the wine and water. We left feeling well satisfied, and not having dined nor imbibed to excess.  Do not dine at Geranium if you are concerned about cost, but do dine there if you want an experience you will not forget. Finally, a tip: the taste starters are all eaten by hand. A hand towel is not supplied until you have finished these.","50"
"Jack2805","Me and my partner booked this lunch a couple of months ago and were very much looking forward to it but it completely exceeded are expectations. We went for the two hour lunch menu which was plenty and we left very full. The food was some of the best I have ever eaten and the service was brilliant, very friendly and welcoming. The best part of the whole experience was the first dessert we got to eat in the kitchen!! They take you into there and watch all the chiefs cooking and preparing plates, it was an amazing restaurant!! I highly recommend if you go to Copenhagen that you visit Geranium","50"
"viaggiat0re_felice","One of the best meals we have ever had. Top notch food and service unmatched by few others in the world. Inventive flavor combinations very skillfully prepared, presented and explained. There was not a single dull morsel over the 16+ courses for lunch. If you're lucky enough to have secured a reservation, you are in for a gastronomic treat of the highest order. We would advise adding the wine pairing vs. picking glasses/bottles from their extensive list - sit back and enjoy the experience, they're professionals at this. I only wish they would have been a tad more generous with the wine pours (they were all excellent)!","50"
"ptbooth","This is the OTHER Michelin 2-star restaurant (2014) in Copenhagen, and Noma happened to be closed for summer break during our visit. So we booked dinner here, knowing very little about it. The setting is a little unusual, up on the 8th floor of an athletic stadium with views of both part of Copenhagen (not the central part) and a running track, but the interior was very nice and probably more spacious than most top restaurants. We had an outstanding view of the kitchen, which was only separated from the dining room by a partial glass wall. The dinner started with a rapid-fire series of “snacks,” followed by the extensive tasting menu. The dishes were amazingly creative, often works of art, but still delicious. They even invited guests to meet the chefs and actually have one of the courses in the kitchen! Service was friendly, yet very professional and polished. They made you truly felt welcome. We chose the juice pairings instead of the wine pairings since we don’t drink, and they were wonderfully unique and complemented the food well. Despite the large number of dishes, we were not overstuffed at the end like one can be at many of these top restaurants. The experience was certainly not inexpensive, but for a perhaps once in a lifetime visit to Copenhagen, it was well worth it to us.","50"
"OlePetersen","Just brilliant, excellent food and service perfect. You feel welcome from first second of you arrival in the restaurant","50"
"saintpanda","Fantastic all around and highly recommended. None of the food was too crazy. Amazing service, the course in the kitchen was great touch. Served by all chefs at least once including head chef Rasmus. Price fair given the level of food and service. Some dishes ranked among the very best flavors I've ever tested. Presentation was sublime. Location and atmosphere outstanding if you come during summer time, the light was simply Perfect.  Have been to a few Michelin restaurants already, this was the best all around experience so far.","50"
"Don H","This is truly one of the best Resturants in all of Europe. We had the 23 course tasting menu with pairings, and if you have 4 hours, it will be one of the most memorable meals anywhere. Each dish is prepared and plated perfectly. The stand out dishes are both the lamb and the langoustines. The starters were excellent and creative as well. This resturant is well deserving of the two Michaline Stars. Food is on par with 3 star resturants, but it does not have the over the topness of a three star. However it is a solid resturant and well worth the trip to the top of a football stadium.","50"
"tdeakon","My wife and I dined on July 12th. Overall the experience would have to stated as simply the best meal we have ever had in our life long pursuit of culinary perfection. The 20 course menu was expertly prepared and presented from beginning to end. The first few courses, the ""snacks"", were creative and delicious with presentations bordering on art. The more substantial main courses were perfectly cooked, precisely seasoned and presented with deft and flair. The standout courses were the ""Dillstone"", Mackerel, Horseradish and Granita from Pickled Cucumber; the Grilled Langustine in Juniper Aroma with Red Elements; and the Lamb, Herbs and Pickled Strawberries. All three desserts were outstanding with a perfect blend between sweet, sour and savoury taste overtones. Particular kudos go to the sous chefs, Jack and Albert for their amazing skill at preparation and presentation and to Pernilla for seamless service.  Well worth the price.","50"
"Graeme G","I ate here tonight for the second time and think it is the best meal I have ever had, and I am a big foodie. I have just finished a tour of my native Scotland and ate at four Michelin star restaurants there which were very good, The Nordic food is fantastic and the 22 course degustation menu with matching wines was divine. I prefer this restaurant to Noma although that too is fantastic if not quirky. GG","50"
"Rachel K","As the title suggests, geranium was singlehandedly the most amazing restaurant I've ever experienced. As a native New Yorker and currently living in Italy, I'm not a stranger to rgff (really good f*king food) and I must say from the food itself to the exceptional service, geranium topped my list. My friend and I got the full tasting menu for lunch with wine pairing. The menu is intensely robust and I would butcher my attempt to recollect each dish including the ingredients..regardless, the concept behind the food is marvelously Scandinavian. Fresh local ingredients, prepared fancifully with such precision to surprise the senses. The wine for the pairing was...not my favorite however. I appreciate the idea behind local wineries but it's like going to Italy for beer or Kansas for seafood. German wines are okay but I didn't particularly like them. Anyway, now for my compliments to the kitchen. They were gracious enough to let us in the back kitchen where each kitchen staff member greeted us and even let us take a ""family photo"" as cheesy as that sounds. I felt like a giggly schoolkid when the head chef stood next to us since he adorns the cover of ever Nordic cuisine magazine. I was really taken aback when they all agreed to do that. Now back to the restaurant, the service was so quick and efficient- with different servers brining different dishes and informing us how to eat each twig/ball/soup (yeah a lot of twigs and flowers). It was a 3 hr foodie paradise and I was so happy at the end I almost cried. Seriously. My mouth now refuses to accept anything subpar. But if I don't want to go broke and begging for money for this newfound addiction, I shall reserve geranium for another visit to copenhagen. All in all, it was AMAZING. Go!","50"
"nicolass208","refinement, incredible creativity, absolutely outstanding. great service and lovely view . certainly a memorable evening, and in the end we got a card with the 25 items we ate liste, but everything was an absolute delight. if i can make a remake ,the 3 desserts were actually slightly below the rest , if one wants to be fussy","50"
"Russell297","We landed in Copenhagen 90 minutes prior to our booking, and booked in to the Nimb with a warm welcome. A little pidgen Danish with the taxi driver confirmed he knew the way to Geranium,and some perfect English in reply from him answered the question that it was, in fact a lake, not a river, and they were large artificial white swans being paddled by recalcitrant children escaping their parents. Our taxi turned in beside the concrete edifice which is the Copenhagen football ground, and stopped around the back in a completely empty carpark next to a canopy with the restaurant Brand on it. An elevator trip to the 5th floor, and the door opens into a special environment where Art and theatre meets food. The restaurant is warm and spacious with stunning views , mostly to the South (when up so far North, most places are to the south). Over the course of the meal we enjoyed a long, stunning Scandanavian sunset then midnight twilight. We were made most welcome from the staff who were knowledgable and attentive over the entire evening. We chose the option of paired wines , juices or beer with each course as the Maitre'D chose, which was most interesting. Over the course of the evening, we had 21 tasting dishes which were sublimely prepared pieces of art, and revealed individual component flavours beautifully. Part of the theatre of the evening included a course served in the kitchen, with, a visit and chat with the head chef. This was a special dining experience which we would recommend to people who wish to experience world class food in an environment which complements it perfectly .","50"
"TLaiS","This is a costly experience by any standard so we studied the reviews - both positive and negative. We enjoyed the longer tasting lunch menu and were blown away! One of our top 5 meals ever - which is quite a statement since we are long-time foodies in our mid-50's. No need to go into detail since other reviewers have done that so well. Just know that we loved the experience and highly recommend it if your budget allows it.   Just a note - if you pay by credit card the restaurant passes on the processing charge which varies by card and country. We are from the U.S. and used our MasterCard. The surcharge was 2.72%. We knew this in advance and were fine with that.","50"
"Robert255068","This is a memorable dining experience. The dishes are imaginative, fully engage and stimulate the senses and make sense as food as well as art. The wine pairings are excellent. The service is perfect. It is not possible to exaggerate the quality and you can believe everything positive you read. It is expensive but you can see exactly where the money goes.","50"
"MadsL989","5 start isn't enough. I Could feel the love for food at every one of the 23 servings. Every plate is a piece of art and the taste of every bite is stored as a memory. The wine menu is a must.  Is it worth to pay the same price for a meal as a planeticket from Copenhagen to Thailand and back costs? The anwswer is YES. The experience exceeded my expectations and is now a memory of an evening I'll nerver forget.","50"
"Roncey","This was a highly anticipated lunch. A local friend raved about the restaurant. We booked in advance as our place to have our capstone lunch after a week in Copenhagen. And we just ate at noma the day before. The expectations ran high, and Geranium far exceeded those expectations.  The food here looked like art. The components of each dish were delicate, and you could tell a lot of work went in to place each item on its own spot on the plate. Some dishes came with presentation at the table. The presentation was not gimmicky; it just allowed us to see a piece of art to transform into another piece of art, like the Norwegian king crab served with cold crab bouillon. Some of the dishes were not what they looked like. The Dill Stone was my favorite and a good example of these visual surprises that also tasted delicious.  The kitchen managed to highlight the fresh ingredients and yet add sophisticated flavors, sensations and even surprises without masking the fresh ingredients. The charcoal potato with smoked sheep butter was a good example. It was black like a lump of coal, it tasted solidly like a perfectly baked potato, and it was enhanced by the tangy sheep butter. Simple, and yet elegant.  Desserts were beautiful and inventive. I still remember the delicate taste of the beeswax ice-cream, which paired nicely with the sweet-tart rhubarb compote. The goat milk mousse with beet crystal candy was simply stunning, but that did not stop me from savoring it.  Were there any misses? Of course. The celery chips in seaweed shape didn’t have much of a flavor, and it was too crumbly to dip in the delicious skyr and seaweed dip. Anyhow, the overall meal – or shall I say the culinary proceeding – was simply delightful.  The restaurant offers wine or juice pairing with the food. One of us did wine, and the other did food. The juices were delicious and gave acidity to keep our taste buds going. The wines were also well selected. Unlike at noma, these wines were less unconventional. For example, noma would serve unfiltered wine from a small winery through its partnership. Here, they just serve really nice wine.  The service was professional and friendly. Don’t let the white table cloth make you think that it is a stuffy place. It’s not. You even get your own copy of the menu to take home. I just love the fact that such an elegant setting could make us feel so at home. After eating there for three hours, we also got to know our servers and learn about them. They were knowledgeable about the food and dedicated to their professions. They even gave us recommendations of where else to eat in the city.  The restaurant is on a high floor in a stadium. So, if you go there during the day and remember to take a break from the beautiful meal in front of you, you can look at the beautiful view outside. We were there on the sunny afternoon, we could see all the way to Malmö, Sweden. Depending on where your table is, you can see into the kitchen, an elegant performance in its own right. Even if you are not near the kitchen, one of the course is served in the kitchen, so you can still enjoy it.  I can’t help compare Geranium to noma. They were both amazing and creative, from food to service, but I prefer Geranium. For me, Geranium strikes a balance of simplicity and elegance, from the food to the décor to the service while noma is bold and edgy. I also like that we had our table at Geranium, so we could have our own conversation. Regardless, if you can, try both, and you can pick your own favorite.","50"
"Marco v","I have tried a number of top quality Copenhagen restaurants, but this was such a highlight! I've been to Noma too, but since I had an apple dish at Noma and a pear dish at Geranium, I will not go and compare... Although I do believe both deserve a third Michelin star for their individual strenghts. Anyway, we had the 23-course Universe Tasting menu, and the matching wines. Søren Ledet was running the restaurant that night, and the service and wines were perfect. Visually, all the dishes were amazing, with incredible flavours to match. The starters came in fairly rapid succession. Highlight were pickled pear with lemon verbena, dried flowers in a skin of dried apple juice, charred potato with sheep butter, and the soup of green asparagus and egg yolk with vinegar. The following ""main"" dishes were all still very light, yet full of flavour. Jellied ham and tomato water served with fresh herbs and flowers, mackarel dillstones with cucumber granita, and salted hake with thyme, asparagus and buttermilk were next. After these dishes we were invited to the kitchen to watch the action from behind Rasmus Kofoed's Bocuse trophies, and were served the razor clam in edible handmade shells there. Back at the table we had fresh apple juice with chamomile, a perfect palate cleanser. The further main dishes included grilled langoustine, served on juniper bush which was briefly set on fire for flavour, and the most incredible, tender and perfectly spiced piece of lamb with summer truffle. A series of desserts, accompanied by sweet champagne and an amazing trockenbeerenauslese, included fresh yoghurt with red sweet branches, and rhubarb with summer flowers, rosehip tea and beeswax icecream. Coffee was filter coffee, freshly made at the table, and a nice show that good coffee doesn't need to be complicated. What an experience!","50"
"Bjorn O","Having been to Noma a few times, we decided to try out Geranium, and had the 23-'course' lunch Universe Tasting Menu. Wow, what an impressive experience, and in my view both Geranium and Noma beats a few 3-star Michelin restaurants in France. To have two world-class restaurants like this in Copenhagen is really a treat.  My favourites on the menu was the Pickled Pear, 'Chared Potato', Oyster with Fish Skin, the 'Dillstones', grilled Langustine, Lamb neck, Yogurt with 'red branches'. What a magic experience, and to have the opportunity to see the kitchen in action is a really good idea!  It is not really fair to compare Geranium vs Noma, but I am going to do it anyhow. The location at the national stadium is odd, however, as soon at you step into Geranium you forget that. The restaurant have a lot more space and bigger tables than Noma, which in my view is better located and have a more cosy feel.   The overall food impression for both restaurants is mind-blowing with Noma being more experimental and Geranium a bit less (in a positive sense), but both out of this world! The staff in both restaurants were both highly professional, but I prefered Noma's more informal style with perhaps more engagement.   The wine menu in Geranium was much more my preference, whereas Noma's wine were more botique wineries from lesser areas, which did not work as well with me. The juice menu in both restaurants is not really worth the money, and in some cases overwhelmed the taste of the food. So overall I still think Noma has a slight edge, but my bet is that Geranium will be the first 3-star michelin restaurant in Denmark, being slightly less outside the box, and with food that is hard to beat - even for Noma.","50"
"Pkoch","We have visited Geranium before, actually the night before they recieved their first Michelin star. And way back then it was our favorite meal, never thought it could be topped. But this evening it did. I had this as a present - dinner with wines and we arrived at 8.00 pm and was taken on a journey through 23 courses - one better than the other. You do not get a menu until you leave - but you do not need one, the waiters explain to you as you get the courses and it is all eatable food - every plate is a artwork. The experience is something out of this World, I can only highly recommend this to all - please go and try - you will not regret. One of the dishes during services is to be enjoyed in the kitchen while you Watch the Chefs Work. It is always SO enjoyable to Watch people do what they love and have passion for. Respect! They do it so well. They are taking good care of you while you are in the kitchen - and it is new and nice to try.  I hope it will not take 5-6 years before we revisit but then Again and experience like this can last a long time. Thnak you Geranium !","50"
"Norm_traveler","Prepare to be dazzle with new taste, texture and flavors. Creativity is the key and what a change from classic french cuisine. The new nordic cuisine is made of fresh local food prepared in a unusual way.  We took the 23 courses menu but relax they are all bite size so you are not too full at the end. I took the wine pairing, and i would suggest it as it really did match the food.","50"
"AvidTraveller2011","What can one say about Geranium, except to say that it was an experience of a lifetime. The restaurant is certainly expensive with the bill for two running close to $1000 (with wine). The chef (Rasmus) conjures magic from every-day foods, while his business partner (Soren) is an expert sommelier. The restaurant was voted as #42 best restaurant in the world recently and the Danish Restaurant of the year in 2013. Having visited Noma (the #1 on the Best Restaurant List), I can say that the ambiance is definitely better in Geranium and the reservation process far more customer-friendly than what Noma has. So, what do you get for $500? A tasting menu with 23 small-late items. Some of the more memorable were the bees wax ice-cream. If I were to go to Geranium again, I would probably choose the juice pairing as the juices they had were definitely intriguing, delicious and healthy! And I would go there in a heart-beat should I have the opportunity again. A definite 5-star experience against which any future restaurant reviewed by me, will be judged.","50"
"Karinawh","Geranium in Copenhagen is by far the best dining experience I've had in my life! From we entered the restaurant everything was nothing less than absolute perfection. Every dish (we had 22) was outstanding and out of this world. A foodgasm in every single bite and the matching wines and drinks were outstanding as well.   Being served one of the desserts in the kitchen was a lovely feature as well and brilliant to see the amazing chefs at work while you enjoy the wonderful food.   The food is art on a plate - and you just never want it to stop coming :-)  I've previously given other restaurants the 5* rating, but after this I'd need to downgrade every other restaurant if I could. This was MINDBLOWING AND AMAZING!!!","50"
"SandraM0725","Not sure I need to go back again but definitely worth the experience. As suggested in the title, each course was incredibly creative but still tasteful. I don't usually like scallops but they were great and the only thing I passed on was the veal tongue. I could have done with a few more things to dip into the great mayonnaise and the sauce with the roe rather than it going to waste but no complaining. For lunch its a pretty pricey endeavor and at first we were doubtful of a venue right by a football stadium. Having said that the restaurant once inside is quite nice and the kitchen as well. The view is very pretty and the staff were very warm and friendly.","40"
"alexkaramanoglou","Dining at Geranium was a beautiful experience. We had lunch there, but I'd probably suggest that people dine there at night since the ambiance may feel more cozy and less cold/exposed. This didn't detract from the impeccable service and gorgeously prepared and presented food. Each dish was a delicious surprise, and dessert was a huge treat since they take you to the kitchen to enjoy it, and meet all the men and women working there. For a restaurant that serves this many dishes and people, the kitchen is spotless, literally.   After dessert, you're escorted to their lounge to enjoy the beautiful views and imported african coffee, and one last small sweet bite.  Very impressive and imaginative food! I would definitely recommend it.","50"
"734FrankJ734","We went to Geranium yesterday. We have been here several times. It is always a very special experience at this restaurant. The food is incredible and so creative with its combinations. The presentation of the food is artwork in itself. On top of this you add some of the best service we have experienced and it just does not get any better. A must for foodies!!","50"
"buratine","We had lunch at Geranium. There are possibility to have an Univers menu which includes 23 small dishes and a lighter version menu with 19 small dishes. My husband and I decided to try the Univers menu and we were stuned with all food we got.The wines and juices were also perfect. Superb service. All in all it was the best food expierence in our lives.  If you love food visit this restaurant at least once in your life, even if you think it is expencive.","50"
"M H S","The location is a bit ""funny"" but when you arrive at the restaurant on the 8th floor you will find there is a nice view from the tables, trendy decorated, clean and cosy. Even the unisex restrooms are nice. The service from the staff was excellent at the beginning but by the end of the evening it was like they ""forgot"" us. Maybe they were just tired! After paying the bill we decided to order a glass of special beer before leaving the restaurant. After waiting ½ hour for this glass of beer we changed our minds and left!  The food came in tiny, tiny bites. 7 tiny, tiny snacks and 13 tiny, tiny courses (some of them hardly a mouthfull). The waiters explained every course with technical details. The food was an enjoyable experience and beautiful presented. However, I am not sure about the value. It is very expensive - DKK18.000 for 6 persons including drinks. The wines were perfect. I really loved the wine. You must enjoy whitewines as only two redwines are served. Off course the wines match the food perfectly.","40"
"Hannington","The waiters demonstrate fantastic patience as they explain a million courses in detail and with enthusiasm. The technical expertise of the kitchen is brilliant and I am proud to have been there and sampled their amazing work.","50"
"Henrik_Hurup","Superb service but the food was so-so. I attended a wine tasting with an Alsace producer. The wine was really the star. The food was bautifully presented but tastewise...not impressed. Very small portions seem to be the trend these days.","30"
"eh555","I struggle to put a rating on this one. Though we had a lovely evening and found the experience very enjoyable, we did not think the food at Geranium measures up to its global peers, especially cost adjusted.  We're lucky enough to have been to Narasawa in Tokyo, Vue du Monde in Melbourne and Alinea in Chicago within the last year, and we enjoyed the food at each of those places MUCH more that at Geranium (and they're less expensive).  All of these wonderful restaurants push the limits on creativity, presentation, and preparation with incredibly intricate and intellectualized food. Unfortunately it seems that taste can sometimes take a back seat when offerings get very complex, and we found that to be the case in a number of our courses at Geranium. There was plenty that was delicious, but there was plenty that just wasn't, in our opinion. Perhaps we don't enjoy the flavor profiles of Denmark as much as the chef and/or locals (a great example would be the onion course which I found to be downright nasty it was so strong). I love juniper, flowers and aromatics, but I found them to be a little overpowering in many of the courses (often reminding me too much of soaps). One of the ""snacks"" at the beginning literally tasted like a sachet of potpourri. This is obviously completely subjective.  Let me say that we thought the service was fantastic - well done. And we LOVED having one of the courses in the kitchen - what a wonderful idea. It was a highlight. The room is gorgeous and the tables are wonderfully large and comfortable - it is a very enjoyable place to spend 3hrs for dinner.   We had a great time, but I wouldn't return, and I would struggle to recommend it, I have to say. If you have money to spare and you like Scandinavian flavors, then you might very well love this place, as many seem to. I have never been to Noma, so cannot compare it to that.  p.s. they take their cancellation policy VERY seriously, so beware before you book. We had to adjust our number from 4 to 3 people eight hours inside their 3 day window and got a penalty charge of 150E (about $225), which really stings.","40"
"LGaryThomas","We had a terrific three hours. It's certainly an odd spot - back of a football stadium - and at lunch the design felt a bit too cool...but the view is fantastic, and the tables are about a mile apart. The food was just brilliant and exciting. There was plenty of wow. And the service was spot on, friendly, serious but unpretentious ""you're going to be eating a lot of flowers today.."".   It's hardly difficult to get a sense of what to expect before you go, so I don't know why people expect big portions. The wine pairing was excellent and fun. Hell..it was all fun! I'd thought the visit to the kitchen might be a bit of a gimmick, but no...it's not like any kitchen I've ever seen - more like a lab, but not in a sterile way, more an extremely stylish futuristic way.","50"
"MartBvB","Had dinner here to start our culinairy tour in Copenhagen. It's an experience that we did not encounter before this.  It's art works that are brought to your table which you can eat, AMAZING, worth every cent.  Wines pairing you just should :)  We've already told many friends about this experience and we'll definitely will be back with friends for some more tasting.  Experiencing one dish in the kitchen is awesome, I’ve never seen such a well organised kitchen with staff working in pure concentration.  As I said it’s an experience :)","50"
"793jedk","A brightly lit room that was 3/4 filled in the soccer stadium . The service was very good, if a little scripted. Everything tasted good but somehow the meal seemed a little tedious. Presentation was very interesting and intricate. The chef- owner was not there so maybe like a broadway play withe the understudy in the leading role. Seemed a little soulless. Everyone was very nice and the course in the kitchen was fun. Wine pairing at 200-300 per person could have had better wines. Plan on spending 600-700 per person. Walked out of klinklin happy and sated, after dinner here hot as much. Not sure I would return","30"
"sidset","We ordered a all-inclusive-experience in Geranium. It was our 5th Michelin-restaurant-visit, and we had all been looking forward to the tasting meny, coffee and chocolate. It started out quite well - every serving was innovative and tasty. Whilst waiting for the meat or fish, we were expecting - suddenly the waitress changed cutlery for dessert. Because the ""main course"" had been served - small pieces of cured beef. What a disappointment. Still hungry (!) we had coffee - one didn't drink coffee, and asked for a glass of white wine instead. It was charged extra on the bill - 178 DKK. The service was ok, but compared to Kiin Kiin, Arzak and Herman - this was truly a disappointing experience. To of my co-eaters went directly to MacDonalds afterwards - to get a cheeseburger. Then something is wrong.","10"
"RougeBlack","Rasmus Kofoed takes New Nordic Cuisine from punk to aristocracy. A culinary ballet created in a world class scenery. Bravo!","50"
"Ccs133","The whole experience of Geranium is wonderful -from the decor and feel when you enter, the birch tree trunks and lichen covered tree branches to the open kitchen which is fun to watch (if you are placed within eyeline of it). The meal is a production (in a good way). There are nearly 30 courses in small portions which leaves you well fed at the end but the effort that goes into making the food a feast for the eyes as well as in the mouth is amazing.   Of the numerous courses, there are some that are memorable enough that well over two months later, it's possible to remember the taste and mouthfeel and to envisage how pretty some of the dishes were. My particular favourites were crispy grains from Kornly; Jerusalem Artichoke and Walnut (mmm);Pickled Pine (really yummy); Sea Urchin & Pickled Elderflower (really pretty and yummy); charred potato & Sheep Milk Yoghurt (wonderful combination); stems with burned garlic, beef & sheep's Milk Yoghurt; ""Smoked Salmon"" with Mustard from Bornholm (wonderful flavour and crunch and smoke effect); dried beetroots & cherry vinegar; Jellied Ham and tomato water (delicate with a lovely little surprise at the bottom); ""Dillstone"", Horseradish & Granita from pickled cucumber (my absolute favourite); ""Razor Clams"" (pretty and delicate); Bread with Emmer & Spelt; Onions, Chamomile & melted Hay cheese (wonderful combination with the pickled onions); Venison,smoked lard and beetroot; ""Fallen apples, Elder & dried leaves; Sheep Milk Yoghurt & crispy beetroots parsleyroot; ""Green Egg"".   I realise that i have listed nearly the whole menu and it's not that i didn't like the other dishes but these dishes listed are memorable and have such wonderful flavour combinations. If pushed to choose one, it would be a toss-up between the Pickled Pine, the ""Smoked Salmon"", the onions,Chamomile and Melted Hay Cheese, the Jellied Ham and Tomato Water and the Dill stones. I think that the Dillstone would have to be the choice. It really does look like a stone but the dill flavoured covering and the fish inside go so well with the accompanying Cucumber Granita and Horseradish - it's such a good flavour combination.  The guests are invited to eat a course in the kitchen with the Bocuse d'Or prizes and the chefs working busily around you. The course we ate in the kitchen- ""Fallen Apples"" was so pretty and the flavour was great. The chefs and the staff are charming and very nice. Service was (as you would expect), excellent. The food can be wine paired, fruit juice paired or alcohol can be selected. It is not the least expensive meal in Copenhagen but it is well worth it. Eating here is a great experience.","50"

Well done Geranium, keep up the great work :)","50"
"Daga2013","Had lunch here with my wife and daughter and it was fun at the time, but in reviewing the experience I am a little bit disappointed. My wife and I had the light lunch with wine and my daughter the juice menu. Looking back there isn´t any outstanding course that I remember as truly great. Maybe that´s because there was served more wine than food-I´m not sure. I also recall many cold courses. The service was ok, but I think it lacked finesse I would expect of such a restaurant. I can´t quite figure out why this place has two Michelin stars. Would I eat here again- probably not. For the amount it cost to eat here I would expect the chef who´s name is on the door to be in the kitchen.","30"
"Nikolay07","Geranium was a crown jewel of our gastronomic program in Copenhagen. The experience turned out to be truly unique. To me, the key to “comprehending Geranium” is that it is not really a restaurant, but rather a gastronomic theater. Therefore, expect a lot of action, movement, constant change of the scene, intrigue, amazement, and discovery. It is not a venue for a romantic dinner, you are never left alone. On the contrary, the show takes you to the sanctuary – the kitchen, where you can observe the action, sitting behind three Bocuses. The food was fantastic, the service choreography – impeccable. I only regret about my choice of juice paring (was too tempting – where else you get one?). Most juice-food combinations did not really work for me (before we reached hot dishes). Do not know about wine, but water can be the perfect background for the brilliant food dishes.","50"
"TheTrueGreatDane","Visiting here with friends, I had great expectations before going and was somewhat a bit disappointed of the experience.  When dining at a 2 star Michelin restaurant, I have set my expectations high, having tried NOMA already I was really looking forward to try this place. Our waiter for the evening was a bit difficult to understand a bit mumbly when introducing wine and food. And the starters seemed to be rushed through, even though I would say we should have plenty of time to see, feel and taste through our senses. All of the courses where delicious however I felt after the dinner something was missing and the best word describing it is with one word would be ""soul"". There was no really big aha experiences and the main course was tasteful absolutely but, personally and personally alone, I think it was a bit too easy or simple if you may. I would love to have given the restaurant 5 out of 5 stars but when having difficulties in understanding or hearing your waiter and the lack of ""soul"" I can only give this experience 4 out of 5 stars.","40"
"eganTrav","I only need to say that they served me more than 20 different vegan courses during two and a half hours, one more amazing then then other, and with juice pairing! I will definitely come back one day, it really was an unforgettable experience... I would have never imagine that it is possible to eat pine branches!","50"
"Zalle78","Summary:  We were two couples that had Geranium as our main purpose of our trip to Copenhagen.  Athmosphere: Modern and stylish - really gives a feeling of exclusivity.  Service: For the first ten dishes (the snacks) we were a bit disappointed. Too many people just rushed by, served the food, told the ingredients and ran away. It felt like we had no time to ask any questions or enjoy our snacks - I think I'd rather would have preferred a few less snacks, with better time to enjoy them. When that said - for the rest of the dinner we had the same head waitress and she delivered top notch. Professional, yet took her time to be personal and really made an effort for us to enjoy our stay, which we did indeed!  Food: This was culinary journey through the dark days of autumn. Not all of the dishes were tasty, but all of them fulfilled my wishes of being creative, delicately served and with flavors I haven't tried before. The only detail I would pick on here would be the salmon skin. I don't expect everything to be tasty, but the smokiness lasted for a long time and spread an unpleasant odor in the room for quite some time. When that said - all together this was a fantastic experience! Decoration was unbeatable   Wine: The wine serving was a bit daring but almost all the wines suited the dishes, and I wouldn't like any changes. The juice served in the middle worked as a perfect taste-breaker. I finished it all with a grappa, and this was an excellent choice.  Value-for-money: What to say? 3250 DKK without tip. For that amount I have sky-high expectations. Geranium almost delivered. They have potential to become one of the best restaurants in the world, but they're not there yet. I'd appreciated some more meat dishes and the service need to be top notch among all the staff, not only partly.   All together it's a five-star experience, but a weak one, given price.","50"
"Raphuu","Nice: Ingredients, assembling, dressing of the plates, wine recommendation, atmosphere. A little less nice: Going to the kitchen to eat dessert is cheesy. Fake fire, cut trees, decoration a little cheesy too.","40"

"sodesa","We had read good reviews about the Geranium, but our dinner last night exceeded expectations. It was sensational food: subtle varied flavours, artistically presented and beautiful to look at...there were about 20 courses, and although the waiters explained the ingredients of each dish, we were sometimes unsure, as each dish was so exquisitely presented set among other inedible elements: eg twigs, pebbles. We opted for juice pairings(as opposed to wines); and had a series of juice concoctions from apple to cammomile The service was also outstanding with the multinational staff always efficient, attentive and friendly. The evening was capped off with a ""tour"" of the kitchen, and photos taken with the chefs.  The whole dinner took 3 1/2 hours and whilst expensive, it was definitely worth it. A night to remember Hard to imagine whether a restaurant can be better than this; but will find out in 3 days time, when we'll be going to NOMA","50"
"Jeppe L","Me and my wife had lunch and it was defiantly a very unique and worthwhile experience.  The restaurant is placed high up with a scenic view over a park. The interior was light and minimalistic, and we had a big table for ourselves with a comfortable distance to the other guests. In general having an atmosphere of a very relaxed lounge.  Staff was friendly and we where served by probably a handful of different waiters, with one being our main server who was also a bit more chatty than the others. The servings was done in a very efficient manner, so we never felt bored or forgotten.  The food is special and clearly not something can get many other places. Portions was mostly snack sized, but with about 20 servings in total we got to taste a great number of wonderful food and could walk away with just a pleasantly full stomach. We where afraid that the food would be more art than food, but it was just the right combination. It looks great and interesting and even though it is weird to start eating small flowers (which they used a lot) - it actually worked quite well with the food and gave a tasting experience we have not had anywhere else.  My wife had the juice menu and I took the wine menu. The juice menu turned out to be the best choice. Very varied and tasteful, whereas the wine menu consisted mostly of white wines with one extremely good Riesling, where the other was merely just plain good.  It is not a place we would return to immediately, because even though the food will still be excellent, the experience of having it all the first time will not be the same. So we will wait till the chefs have experienced with some new ideas and changed the menu.","50"

"Alice-R01","In anticipation of being in Copenhagen on my birthday I was looking for an outstanding restaurant. Unfortunately July limits your choices as many elite restaurants are closed during this time. Fortunately Geranium was open. I made reservations and then received an email noting if I failed my reservation I would be charged 150 euros/person. As were flying in on the morning of the reservation I didn't want to take a chance and cancelled my reservation. Upon arriving in Copenhagen on time I emailed the restaurant and asked if there still might be availability for my special occasion meal. They emailed me back promptly that there was and we went at 1230. The restaurant is located at the soccer stadium and our taxi driver wasn't too sure I knew what I was talking about. The restaurant is located on the 8th floor with a great view of the city and the waterway. We had the full tasting with the juice menu. They easily accommodated my vegetarian diet. I eat dairy and eggs. The meal was about 3 hours long. 1100Kr for the food and 500Kr for the juice tasting menu. About $286. It was a lot of fun. The food was very creative, and elaborately prepared and presented. The place settings are not as elaborate as say the French Laundry, and service was attentive, but a little scattered as there were different waiters and waitresses serving us. Towards the end of your service you are invited to go into the kitchen and observe. We were sitting next to the glassed in kitchen and watched. People asked for pictures with the chef etc. We were served one of the courses in there. It was nice touch. What stood out for me was the clear tomato soup, and the mushroom soup. The food was light and of course these places don't give you much per course. There was a bread course of little loaves about an inch long, otherwise no bread. By 6 pm my stomach was growling. We really enjoyed the juice tasting menu. Compared to the French Laundry, where I've dined a few times, the service was a bit lacking, but only because you got confused who was helping you. The food at the French Laundry is much richer also. My companion had the main regular tasting menu without any dietary restrictions and noticed this also. Dining in Copenhagen is expensive in general, so I didn't this this was overpriced at all. Would go again for a special occasion.","50"
"Elliot J","This is probably the finest meal I have ever eaten in my life. It was food and art combined, with exquisite taste and aesthetic presentation. My mouth probably experienced several orgasms during the evening. The restaurant is spare but beautiful. Tables spaced appropriately at a distance so that no conversations overlapped. The service was exquisite, with very careful attention to keeping the water and wine glasses filled at all times. Every course (21 of them!) was served on a different shaped plate. The head chef, Rasmus, helped to serve and explain several courses and the other co-owner, Storen, also stopped by to chat. Towards the end of the meal, we were invited (as I guess all guests are invited) to come into the kitchen to observe and to have a cup of cold tea of unknown but delicious origins. The kitchen is as clean, spartan and immaculate as an operating room. The multiple chefs quietly and studiously work bent over their plates, creating the minutiae of each serving as a work of art. There is a hush in the kitchen -- no shouts, no banging pans, only choreographed silence and coordination.  This is a gastronomical experience -- not just a meal. However, for those who contemplate dining here, one should know that there is only one meal -- there are no choices whatsoever. Wine pairings are offered or one may order separate bottles of wine. The price, for the meal and moderately-priced wine, is about $400 (US) per person -- so come prepared for sticker shock.   For us ""average Joes"", this may be a once in a lifetime dining experience.","50"
"thzurich","We enjoyed a fun and very tasty dinner at Geranium. The food is very creative, absolutely delicious, beautifully presented and fun. We had the full tasting menu accompanied with matching juices - highly recommend it! The juices are mostly home made and selected to go with the specific dishes - a really good idea for those who are ""lightweights"" or simply enjoy something different. The staff were also very polite, but without being cold. Our waitress Pernille was super helpful and made us feel very welcome and well-looked-after. This place is truly sensational!","50"
"DCNJ11","Dining at Geranium was the highlight of our trip to Copenhagen. It was an amazing experience with phenomenal food. The service is also perfection - they clearly love what they do and their attitude is one of being excited to serve you such wonderfully fresh and interesting food. Chef Rasmus also served several of the courses himself and oversaw the plates leaving the immaculate kitchen.   It's certainly not an inexpensive dinner (but surely you would know that before making a reservation). If you enjoy crazy good food, Geranium will not disappoint.","50"
"suntrip62","We recently had a four hour phenomenal dining experience at the lovely Geranium restaurant in Copenhagen.

"5fortravel","Seemed a little pricey and the thought of a three-hour lunch or a ""lighter"" lunch of two hours seemed a little much. When the first few dishes came, the food didn't even look like food. It was like a piece of art. The food comes out very slowly and the portions seem laughably small until you realize that there are more than 10 dishes. More memorable than French Laundry. Some of the most unique presentations and tastes I have every had. Not all of them work but truly a culinary adventure.","50"
"3boysdad66","I have absolutely no doubt that if you like this sort of thing then this is the sort of thing you will like. The restaurant really is moderately extraordinary as an artistic gastronomic experience.  My wife and I enjoyed the 3 hour lunch, with wine and juice pairings, on a beautiful day in a beautiful city.  Previous extensive rhapsodic reviews preclude any need to go into any detail on the food itself. I cannot usefully add to the descriptions from the foodies who have already used all of the adjectives in their extensive lexicons on this and other review sites for Geranium. The fact that I really don't ""get"" foodie food says more about the heathen that I am than it does about the kitchen. However I loved looking at it, beauty indeed, and enormously enjoyed the outstanding service and presentation.  For me this was more an exquisite performance than a meal, performance art if you like. In fact there is more ""art"" on the plate here than I have seen in many shows and exhibitions of painting and sculpture in the past couple of decades. It appears that the torch of creativity has been handed on from studio to kitchen.  Unless you plan to dine here regularly the price is immaterial. Sure it's expensive but it is also an extraordinary experience  The only specific food related comment I'd make is that, on reflection, I wish we'd simply ordered a bottle of Zind Humbrecht rather than take up the wine pairing.","50"
"Tpthertz","The room has a simple elegance to it- quiet, peaceful, nice view. We ate dinner as the late summer sun set- a leisurely 4 hour dinner. The food was delicious, beautifully presented- the dining experience was joyful. Various waitstaff and chefs introduced courses to us- including the head chef. We had a tour of the immaculate kitchen as they were tweeting flowers onto one of our many desserts. It was a very special evening event!. Also as restaurants go it was fairly easy to get a reservation.","50"
"J N","It's not just a meal, it's an experience -- it's nearly theatre. Really creative ""new Danish"" cuisine, amazing service, and fantastic atmosphere. (Unlike similar high-end restaurants I've been to in the US, Geranium's room is airy and open and comfortable. Must be the danish Modern style.)","50"
"ConneyToronto","OMG this is by far the best food I have ever tried!! I havent tried Noma since they are closed for july so had no chance to compare the two. In any case, I thought I was in Food Heaven when I had the first bite of anything there! when we arrived at the buidling, we met a fellow canadian chef picking seasonal flowers downstairs for one of the dishes to be served. Everything served was created by inspirations from the great nordic outdoors.   The decor was elegant and minimalistic , very scandinavian and posh. Tables spread very wide apart. The whole restaurant probably had 15 tables the most? Big tables that seat 4 or 5. This is the epitome of creativity and culinary intelligence! We have dined everywhere and never have I seen or tasted food at this level. creme filled flavoured chocolate dusted with Pine - I mean who has ever heard of that? Pine? Bamboo clams served in an edible clam shell which replicated the real shell . Initially we thought it was the real shell until our server told us that it was edible and when bit into it, felt like a light cracker. The details and skills that went into every dish is an art in itself. Not to be missed when in Copenhagen . We had the 2 hours tasting menu, if not for time, my husband and i agreed we could have done 3! There must have been 18-20 dishes all of which were superbly original. The head chef even served one of the courses, our server happily explains every dish to us in detail . very professional staff and always a smile on their faces. Every dish was so beautifully presented, and tasted out of this world that our very fussy daughter even gave it the thumbs up. Our kids had to order seconds of the bread made with spelt..   Truly unique experience, a must try if you are a foodie. It was very pricey but worth it , it's not just food, it's art.  I wont recommend kids as food is very exotic , unless you have very adventurous ones..","50"
"dioladetus","This ranks as the best food and eating Ive ever had! Have visited many top restaurants including Noma, but this is by far better tasting. Very original food, everything from the top shelf. Applaus! Highly recommended.","50"
"MPejter","We had been trying to get reservations at Geranium for a while - there are very few tables available online for only two guests. We finally managed to persuade some of our friends to join, and getting reservations for four was relatively easy.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated - very Nordic inspired - and the staff highly professional, charming and fun; no raised eyebrows or arrogant behavior. One of the owners Soren was in the restaurant and gave the entire experience a little extra.  The food was absolutely amazing. Not only were the ingredients challenging and the presentation innovative and beautiful - the food actually also tasted out of this world good. Of highlights are worth mentioning the lobster, the charred potatoes and the razor clam as well as the rhubarb dessert.  The wine pairing was generous, challenged our taste buds and matched the food to perfection  Copenhagen has long been associated with Noma on the culinary world map - Geranium is certainly in the same league and if you ask me based on eating both places slightly better.","50"
"pushplay","This meal was an intellectual, humorous and tasty trip through the essence of Danish cuisine. We had the full lunch course with juice pairing, and it was wonderful. The room is spacious and surrounded by windows that look onto a green field, underlining the connection of the food with nature. Staff was very welcoming and educated, and we enjoyed perfect course services every time. Sure, it's expensive, but the meal lasts for 3 hours and it's like a show.","50"
"PATSR_GO","From the first course until the little extra desert while we waited for a cab, this was an experience. However, bring all the Krone you can rustle up, as it was the most expensive meal I could ever imagine. Over $2000.00 for a party of 4, with wine.","50"
"MandKSurrey","6 of us were taken to Geranium by a very generous friend - it's not the kind of meal you eat often!  We were eating before a concert in the stadium. The welcome was very friendly, and throughout the meal the service was the best I've ever experienced in a restaurant. It was like something from a film - you barely noticed the staff, and it never felt like they were hanging around, but plates were cleared the minute the last person had finished eating, new courses were served to all 6 at precisely the same time, and the food and drinks were introduced in a friendly, knowledgeable manner.  The food was simply excellent - very, very fresh and with the rare feature that you could taste every single ingredient. Portions were small but not tiny, and I was genuinely full after eating (helped along by the last / main course of pork belly I'm sure). Dessert was also delicious, with the frozen herb tea topping surprisingly good.  I wasn't drinking alcohol at the time of our visit, and was therefore given the juice tasting menu to match the food. Many people say this is a better accompaniment, and I wouldn't argue. Whilst some of our party were unimpressed by some of the wines, the juices were all delicious, with the apple and cucumber a highlight.  Certainly a meal I'll always remember.","50"
"dchccph","Innovative food, nice service and a amazing view of the town. You just have to experience this restaurant.","50"
"Daniel L","After deciding to travel to Copenhagen with only about two months notice, I was unable to get into Noma (or Faviken in N. Sweden, my next stop) so I made a back up plan. I went on Noma's website and found out where Redzepi alumni were working and hit those places. Geranium was one of them and wow did I make the right call. This place was amazing. The room was gorgeous, the staff was the best, my seat stared right into the service kitchen and the food was New Nordic (i don't like calling it that) at its best. I can't even articulate the perfection I experienced. Each dish was well conceived, had ingredients predominatly indigenous to the region (i heard the chef say he rides his bike down to the ocean to gather sea moss, i mean, wtf), was artfully presented in a nordic style and was balanced in taste and texture. And for all its elegance the food was very approachable. I could go on and on but I am writing this on my phone so I should just say, visit this place, and further, visit this city. Copenhagen is where it is at culinarily right now and is just a cool city.","50"
"KiwiRoadrunner","This is a restaurant for true foodies - those of us who love the thrill of trying something different, something crazy, something we can't cook/make ourselves (or wouldn't bother to), something incredibly creative, but downright tasty. That to me is what Geranium was all about - 22 tastes of pure food innovation. The service was absolutely spot on in every respect. The wine pairings all made sense (and thank goodness you don't get 22 wines - some pours go with 2 or 3 courses as appropriate - but they tell you that when they pour). For full disclosure, my husband wants me to note that he gives this restaurant a 4 because he did not feel like he had a meal, just lots of amuse bouches. And there was only one savoury meat dish (a few slices of dried meat). He really would have liked one or two more substantial portions with meat in them to rate this a 5. We choose to disagree! :) I think this is an experience to have at least once in your life! As for practicalities - the restaurant is in a building attached to the stadium. If you happen to go on a night of a big concert (like we did), be forewarned that the taxi will take twice as long to get you there and they won't be allowed to drive you to the door so you have to fight your way past all the concert goers and convince the gate staff to let you in. The restaurant did call one for us to go back to the hotel though so that worked well.","50"
"john_dera","It's as well that I had no expectations before my visit to Geranium I would have failed miserably !! This was artistic theatre of the very highest level that took one into the realms of fantasy land. To excite one visually and stimulate the palette through a musical symphony of food incorporating new ingredient, textures combined with immaculate balance takes extraordinary thought and execution performed dish after dish. The dishes were all presented in tandem with natures elements of stone, wood,glass etc. One dish I had "" Razor Clams "" was presented on a base of sea pebbles with the delicate pencil like shell resting upon it, except the shell was not a shell at all but constructed of the most delicate pastry that has ever passed my lips with its exquisite clam filling which upon lifting with the greatest care simply evaporated in ones mouth. It would be unfair of me to elaborate further you must truly experience this masterful cooking at least once in your life.","50"
"GF2011","My wife and me had the Lunch Universe Tasting Menu with accompanying juice paired with the dishes. The dishes were very good, as was the matching with the juices.   We were however disappointed by the service.  Worst was that when we had returned home and read the menu that was handed out after the meal, we noticed that one of the dishes had not been served to us. We wrote and informed Geranium about it, but did not even get a reply.  Furthermore, guest from most tables were invited to see the kitchen, which we would also have enjoyed. This left a bad taste that unfortunately let down the food.","30"
"LuxeFamilyFun","Okay, we admit being disappointed to not get into NOMA - but I can't imagine how it could be as good as Geranium, much less better. We've had some really esoteric meals over the last year, including e' in Las Vegas and Grace in Chicago, but Geranium trumps them all.  If you don't mind experimenting with eating pine, celeriac chips, cep soup and moss, Geranium is awesome. Of course it's quite difficult to access and the price is heady.  The space is fantastic - minimalistic with an earthy edge. Twelve of the thirteen tables were occupied, four with solo diners - either adventure travelers, visiting chefs or food industry professionals.   We chose the ""three hour"" experience and it whisked along quite fast and furious. The service was great - we could have use a touch more friendliness from one of our staff. That is a small complaint in a sea of good fortune.   Courses flowed from the kitchen with precision and professionalism. No detail was too small or too big. Jerusalem artichoke, seabuckthorn, pickled egg yolk in a cep soup, jellied ham in tomato water, razor clams stuffed into something yummy that I forget, turbot covered in moss, dessert yogurt from happy cows and more awesomeness.   The matching wine pairing was equally impressive - esoteria gone wild. Some fascinating pairings.   We departed after three hours of pure entertainment - not overly stuffed - a big billed we deemed good value and the promise that a cab would be waiting for us outside in five minutes.  Five minutes from departing the lobby, our cab pulled up and we whisked back to our hotel. Precision, just like the entire afternoon.","50"
"HeineHustedH","This is by far the best restaurant experience of my life. Geranium out-shines Noma by far if you ask me. Geranium has found the perfet balance between challenging you as a customer and providing you with a meal that feels like a meal. From the minute we entered the large open room we got the impression that we had been expected, the table and our waiter was ready and the service throughout the night was friendly, impeccable and always attentive enough to react to all our whims. Even the chefs had enough cool to be able to interact with us guest to make us feel more like a part of their team than their bread and butter - That alone rewards them 5 ""stars"" from me. The food was beautifully presented and crafted to perfection, and none of the numerous plates were less than perfect. The 5 hours went far too quickly and we all felt that we had gotten value for money and would the next day again if possible.","50"
"Tania_Chris","We don't drink alcohol and we really enjoyed that the restaurant actually offered matched juices throughout the meal. There are only a handful of restaurants that do this!  The food was fun and interesting. The flavours were well thought-out and executed. The number of chefs in the kitchen was impressive.  They take you into the kitchen for pre-dessert which is a lovely touch.  The desserts themselves were the only let-down for us. They were somewhat simple and not-too-impressive compared to the beginning of the meal.  If you are looking for the restaurant, the entry is around the back of the stadium and it is up in the stadium! Oh and don't trust apple maps whatever you do, it has it in completely the wrong place!","50"
"ConkhiAuckland","We dined at Geranium the day after Noma. We were very pleased we dined in that order, otherwise Noma may have seemed a bit of a let-down! Although we all really enjoyed the Noma experience, we all thought that Geranium was better overall - especially if you compare the levels of tastiness of the food. The service at Geranium was friendly, but impeccable. As each dish was served, the waiters would co-ordinate placing our dishes down at the same time - this looked very impressive, especially as this was done with all very discrete gestures between the waiters. The dishes served were all very unique and certainly looked and tasted unique - lots of little suprises, which I won't disclose so you can enjoy yourselves! I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers when they state that Geranium was suprisingly better than Noma. As we were the last table to finish our meals, I asked if we could have a kitchen tour, which was very extensive! We were even given a quick tour of the wine room. Geranium is one of my most favourite dining experience so far, loved everything!","50"
"Derya K","Went to Geranium with friends recently. I truly can say; it is teh best food and service I have ever seen in my entire existence!!!!  The chef Rasmus already has 2 Michelin Stars but I reckon he needs anther 10! What an amazing experience - how can he create such nice dishes; just beyond me. It is not cheap but if you want to see the best Chef in the world - head there.... You will not regret! Book well in advance.  If you ask for the tasting menu; a great chance you will be invited to the kitchen for the last course! Enjoy!","50"
"blackhillssilver","Beautiful. Art. A Food Experience. This was a great choice for our goal of dining at some of Copenhagen's best restaurants. We were surprised at the location, at the Parkens Stadium... but on the 8th floor there was no indication that we were in a stadium, as all the windows faced outward toward city views. The staff were very warm and friendly, not pretentious. We especially enjoyed being invited into the kitchen for one of the courses, where we were able to visit with a few of the chefs. There is a balance between great, real food and the amazingly creative experimentation happening in today's kitchens. Personally, I favor real food and prefer to know what I'm tasting. For the most part, Geranium kept with this integrity.","50"
"Restaurantcritic-eu","SE DANSK ANMELDELSE PÅ http://www.restaurantcritic.eu/the-reviews/denmark/geranium  SEE FULL REVIEW AND PICTURES AT http://www.restaurantcritic.eu/the-reviews/denmark/geranium  Overall rating: 7.5-8/10 Before I say anything else: If you go to Geranium, choose the juice menu! Geranium is run by 2011 Bocuse D’or winner Rasmus Kofoed, who earlier had won both bronze and silver in the competition. The restaurant previously had a very small premise in Kongens Have (the King’s garden) next to Rosenborg in Copenhagen, but closed down when Kofoed and the new owner couldn’t agree on the visions of the restaurant. After a hiatus, the restaurant opened again in the unlikely settings of the national football stadium, although Kofoed did say that he hadn’t imagined he would want to run a restaurant in a place mostly associated with football, hot dogs and beer in plastic cups. Kofoed had previously been the chef in the restaurant of Denmark’s most prestigious hotel, D’angleterre, but was fired for refusing to cook among other things a dish that translates to “shooting star” (a piece of toast with mayonnaise, lettuce, a filet of fish, prawns and fish eggs). Since winning Bocuse D’or, it has been very difficult to book a table at Kofoed’s restaurant for dinner, but my wife and I managed to get a table for lunch with relative ease. The restaurant itself is really beautiful and classy, and definitely one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been too. It suited the cooking very well. The entire kitchen was visible from the restaurant if you were sitting in the right place.  The restaurant had two lunch options: A short and a long menu. We chose the long one for 998 kroner (€134). The menu actually didn’t show the courses but just listed some of the ingredients that was part of the menu. We also chose the juice menu at 498 kroner (€67) – and good thing that we did. More about that later. Water was free, and this was actually a first in a top restaurant in Copenhagen (I don’t remember if we just asked for tap water, and there therefore were no charge as opposed to bottled water). First we had several small snacks: Puffed potato crisps with sea weed with just the right amount of sea weed and a sphere filled with sea buck thorn on the side. The sphere was one of my wife’s favourite things about the meal. Next we had cheese sticks with a bit of soft cheese with leaves on top for dipping. Then a spiral of crispy Jerusalem artichokes was served with a cream of walnut oil, which I found quite tasteless. On the side were razor clams that was cleverly made to look like they were still inside their shell, but the crispy shell was actually edible. I don’t like clams or mussels (including razor clams), but this was actually quite refreshing, although not spectacular in taste (although visually it was definitely spectacular). The star of the appetizers was a small soup of cep mushrooms with a few chopped ceps. Nothing short of astonishing, and one of the absolute highlights of the meal. On the side we had a really lovely pine lemonade, although that didn’t seem to be part of the juice menu.  The first real course was a jellied ham and tomato “soup” (in separate layers) with small balls of radishes with thyme on top. A beautiful looking dish with pleasant flavours, but still on the mild side. Admittedly, I find radishes to be quite plain, and here they didn’t do anything for the dish at all. The ham and tomato combination seemed to be a wink to southern Europe, so melon instead of radishes could have been a better and more tasteful option (7/10).  “The perfect scallop” served in a scallop shell was for me a disc containing grains due to a misunderstanding between me and the waiter (more on that later), whereas my wife had the scallop itself. I only had a small bite of hers, so I can’t really comment too much on that, but it did seem less cooked than I prefer. I found my grains to be quite plain, as there, if I’m not mistaken simply wasn’t added anything to the grains – no herbs or anything. I find it quite limiting how much flavour you can extract simply from whole grains. The sauce of celeriac, browned butter and elderberries was magnificent though, and might have been the best element in the entire meal. (9 or 10/10 for the sauce, but 5/10 for the grains)  Hake was raw and slightly smoked and covered with a bit of skyr (a Scandinavian diary product). In the centre of the plate was a horseradish sauce as well as stems of seaweed. When hake is at its best, it can be magnificent, but I do prefer it pan-fried. The amount of smoke was perfect though. The sauce was nicely balanced with just the right amount of horseradish, but I didn’t care too much for the seaweed. By this time I had had enough of seaweed/algae flavours – especially since the accompanying juice was made of apples, cucumber and, once again, algae. That juice, however, was well-balanced. The skyr also seemed to vanish a bit when combined with the smoked fish. As such there was nothing wrong with this dish, but there wasn’t much excitement about it (6/10).  Red onions came with water cress, crumbles of rye bread that was fried crisp and a sauce made from Danish hay cheese. The onions were good but nowhere close to the astonishing ones at Noma the next day. The real star of the show was, once again, the sauce. Perfectly balanced and just the right intensity in flavour. The rye bread was however in so small pieces that it had become hard rather than crisp (overall 7.5/10, but more for the sauce).  Neither of us were particularly fond of the next dish which was oyster (which I had asked to be removed) with a salad with fish eggs on top. Again, the sauce that was poured on at the table was the best element. Granted, if you really like oysters, clams, fish eggs and everything else with those types of flavours this was probably a great dish, but as it simply was to neither our liking it’s difficult to score it higher. Technically, it did also seem to be less impressive than the rest. The leaves were soggy, and the combination of flavours was quite limited. (5/10)  Next, however, was one of my favourites of the meal. Again, the misunderstanding with the waiter caused us to have two different dishes. I had a white asparagus, whereas my wife had a langoustine cooked with hay. They were brought in on a tray and then arranged on a rectangular plate at the table. The asparagus seemed woody and tasteless, but luckily we shared 50-50. My wife seemed to like the asparagus better than the langoustine, and I enjoyed the langoustine more. The langoustine was probably the least cooked langoustine I’ve ever had, so the texture was a bit soft and “slimy”. Nevertheless, the flavour was magnificent, the hay flavour being a great combination with the sweet langoustine. I believe the sauce was made with verbena (9/10 for the langoustine).  The main course was slightly smoked deer covered with a sheet made from cherry vinegar served with beetroot in various forms and a berry sauce. The deer itself was spectacular, but I simply missed variety in the other elements, as everything except for the sauce and the sheet was beetroot. One beetroot looked like a vanilla pod. I’m not sure how they made it, but it was a strange sensation – dry and a bit “dark” in flavour. Although there were some acidic sorrel leaves on there, I could have used something light and refreshing in this dish, for instance peas (overall 8/10, but more for the deer itself).  A pre-dessert was a very fluffy elderberry foam with crunchy elderberries at the bottom. Especially the texture was worth mentioning, as the airy lightness worked really well with the refreshing flavour (7.5-8/10).  We both agreed that the first dessert might have been the best dish overall in the entire meal. A thin layer of white chocolate panacotta was covered by another layer of green sorrel panacotta. On top was fresh sorrel leaves that hid granulated frozen white chocolate. At the table, the waitress poured on similar granulated frozen sorrel. The only tiny complaint about this was that it was just a tiny bit too acidic, but nevertheless it was a marvellously refreshing dessert, and the combination of white chocolate and sorrel worked astonishingly well. (9/10). The accompanying glass of juice was, maybe a bit too obviously, sorrel juice. Had they added something more to the juice it would have improved the combination between juice and food a bit.  The last dessert was a beautiful looking rhubarb compote with edible flowers, with cream being poured on at the table. As opposed to at Noma the rhubarb, was sweet and clearly the best element in this dish for me. Although I liked the flowers, I find edible flowers to be a bit too perfumed, and here there were too many to my liking. The cream was just cream, and the flavour vanished a bit with this combination. They could have added something to the cream – vanilla, lemon zest, anything. Or maybe a foamy buttermilk instead would have worked well. My wife did like this dish a lot more than me (7/10).  After this we had a few petit fours. It was served while I was in the toilet, so I didn’t know what it was. One was a leaf, and I simply couldn’t place the flavour. So, although it looked nice, the taste obviously didn’t hit the mark. It was carrot. The other was a chocolate egg with a ginger filling if I’m not mistaken. That was definitely much better.  Then there’s the juice menu. Like I said in my review of Noma, some people couldn’t dream of going to a restaurant like this and not have wine with the food. What I can say is that a good sommelier will be able to find a wine that suits each course well, but he’ll never be able to find something that suits it as well as a drink that the restaurant has made especially for that dish. We both agreed that the juice menu here made the meal even better, and both here and at Noma the juices matched the food extremely well. When I go to high end restaurants I usually have 2-3 glasses of wine with the food, but I have never before had a meal where the food and the beverages were such a great match as it was at Geranium and Noma. We had these juices: * Algae, cucumber & apple * Holsteiner cox apple juice * Ingrid marie apple juice & tarragon * Bodil Neergaard apple juice * Grape & juniper berries * Woodsorrel juice * Rhubarb juice. Although the apple juices were all great, and they really showcased the spectacular quality that Danish apples truly have, I was nevertheless a bit disappointed that there were no fewer than three apples juices in a row (four if you count the first juice as well). The rhubarb was a bit overpowered by the content of rose water (which was still light), and it simply was a bit too sour and lacked the sweet flavour of rhubarb (which they had brought out quite well in the dessert that accompanied the juice). That is really my only criticism of the juices. Especially the apple juice with tarragon was a delight. The service was mostly capable and certainly better than what I for instance had at Mortens Kro in Aalborg, but I felt there was a somewhat chilly detachment from the staff. We were served by a male waiter and a female waitress, and initially I felt they had a bit of an icy distance, but it got better over time, and the male waiter did loosen up and became more talkative. It seemed he had also helped make some of the dishes, so he could answer all our questions about the food. I overheard our waitress tell the table next to us that she was an intern. We all have to start somewhere, so I can of course forgive her for mixing things up and not being able to answer all our questions. I for instance asked: “Does this juice contain lemon balm?”, and she responded “I really have no idea”. The waitress started to take a glass of my wife’s juice away (she wasn’t going to finish it), and when I said “I can finish that” the waitress looked devastated. The same thing happened at Quique Dacosta in Spain, but before I even got the chance to say I would like to finish it, the waitress asked me. Maybe the waitress at Geranium saw us as difficult customers. Fair enough – I don’t hold a grudge against her for that. We went to Noma the next day, and after just half an hour there we already felt happier and more welcome. Herman in Copenhagen is also very “posh”, but the service there was more relaxed and down to earth. At heart, the waitress at Geranium did seem sweet, but I think she might just have felt a bit lost and unprepared. All the guests at Geranium, or at least most of them, were asked if they wanted to see the kitchen. We weren’t asked. We did see the kitchen though, as my wife asked for it. We did also get to meet the chef, and take a picture with him, as he arrived shortly before we left. The pace of the meal was perfect. No waiting and no rushing. They managed this with only three (or was it four?) waiters. I told the male waiter that I didn’t like oysters and clams/mussels. We were then served a scallop, but I had grains instead. I then told him that I do like scallops. His response was: “Oh? It’s just, you said you didn’t like oysters and clams”. Okay, apparently I hadn’t been very clear on this, but instead of clearing the issue up, he just walked away. So, when we were served a langoustine, which I also like, I was served a white asparagus instead. But okay, this did mean we had the chance to try more different things. For the salad, they had just removed the oysters from my dish, but the waitress had swapped our dishes, so I, and not my wife, had the one with oysters. Lastly, we asked for one juice menu to share, and the waitress came back to clear up if we just wanted one menu in one glass. I said “yes, just one, so we just pay 498 kroner. If you want to serve it in two glasses that’s fine too, but just one menu to share”. When we asked to share a juice menu next day at Noma it was no problem at all. At Geranium they served it in two glasses, and when we had the bill it said two juice menus. I asked the male waiter about this and said that if we had drunk two juice menus we would of course pay for two (apparently we did get two full juice menus). He, however, insisted he would make a new bill with just one juice menu if that was what we had asked for, so the service did end on a very positive note, and better than I would have expected of many restaurants. After the meal, I asked if I could have the recipe for the cep soup, and the cook who had it said he would e-mail it. A month and a half later I still hadn’t received it, so I wrote the restaurant an e-mail about it. They never responded. So, to conclude, there were some definite highlights, but when we left the restaurant I nevertheless felt there had been something missing. Coincidentally, I spoke to a cook from Kødbyens Fiskebar the next day, and a friend of his had also been to both Geranium and Noma and had said the exact same thing: “Somewhat similar food, but you simply forgot more quickly what you have eaten at Geranium”. It’s of course not fair to judge Geranium by comparison to Noma rather than in its own right. We agreed that it was a nice meal, but not one of the most memorable one’s we’ve had. All I can say is that Geranium simply wasn’t as memorable as Noma was, and Geranium wasn’t as memorable as for instance Quique Dacosta, Sant Pau, Sangonereta and Gordon Ramsay (in Chelsea, London) were either. All dishes at Geranium looked great, and all exuded elegance, visions (most of the time), and high quality ingredients. Especially the amount of smoke was extremely well-balanced. Many people (especially the ones who smoke salmon or mackerel) could learn something here. Technically, I couldn’t fault anything except for the soggy leaves in the salad dish, the asparagus, and the hard rye bread. Clearly, the staff in the kitchen is very talented. It’s of course a matter of taste if you prefer elegance to intensity. I say “live fast and die young” so to speak. I simply prefer food where you really remember the depth of flavour. Nevertheless, Sant Pau in Spain serve elegant food as well, and that was one of the best meals I’ve ever had. It seems that Geranium wants to do light and elegant food, and I often lacked some depth of flavour – so the memory of the meal quickly started to fade. I did also feel that for instance the hake was simply not used to its full potential, the amount of sea weed/algae and smoked ingredients were maybe just a tad too much, and at times there was simply a slight lack of complexity, flavour or imagination in some of the ingredients (the walnut cream from the appetizers, the grains, the entire salad dish, the asparagus, the beetroots, the cream for the rhubarb dessert, the carrot petit four). Another problem was that if you asked for something to be changed on the menu, the replacements frankly weren’t particularly interesting (the grains and the asparagus). Even though the service was far from bad it did mar our visit, and it has dragged down the overall score. Nevertheless, the place and the food radiated luxury. If you prefer elegant and mild food, then Geranium is definitely one of the best places in Copenhagen. It is worth noting the quantity of food you get for the price. 998 kroner/€134 is not cheap in any way, but if you know the price levels in Copenhagen, and Denmark in general, it doesn’t seem expensive at all. It’s around 100 kroner per actual dish (not counting snacks). Cofoco, which is also very good, but not really at this level, charges 85 kroner per dish. In Copenhagen it’s very difficult to find a good quality three course meal for less than 300 kroner (€40). A sirloin steak with béarnaise sauce at the dreadful chain Jensens Bøfhus is 200 kroner (€26) – and that’s just one dish.","40"
"rutger v","What is the real tast of any food ingredient, you first now after visiting geranium. A dish in this restauarnt is like eating it on the spot where it had been living, and that what is all about. Fresh from ground to table. They do use Nordic products. Only what is growing in this clean and cold area, slowly because of short days, but with better tast development, wonderful dishes, creative cooking. We were very satisfied with the timing of dishes too. It is turly an amazing experience. The service there is excellent, and we agreed that it is all the way through a fantastic experience. I've eaten at some of the world's best restaurants, this one is one of them. This is definitely do to the unique flavors you experience","50"
"Berlineric1963","For a 50th birthday treat we spent a few days in Copenhagen. Friends assured us that we should eat at Geranium and not Noma, and because nibbling on bits of seaweed didn't appeal, we booked here and chose the full option menu with 22 courses and wines to match. Brilliant. The staff are all knowledgable and you can ask anything and the ratio of dinner guests and staff in the dining room is almost 1:1. The ""dragon with the girl tattoo"" (sommelier) puts on a bit of an attitude at first, with a bit of the misplaced arrogance of a first class cabin attendent (think Penny in ""Come Fly With Me"") but warms up later -- I suppose it's all part of the show. But it's not *just* show. The food is spectacular and interesting and weird, but in a wonderful, thought-through way. The pairing of food and wine are sublime and the entire experience was worth the eye-watering price. Save up and do this.","50"
"Kevin F","Wow would be the one word that describes this restaurant.  My partner and I booked ourselves in for a Geranium lunch while on vacation in Denmark and it was definitely worth it!  I'll admit, when I first arrived at the restaurant I wasn't sure why they chose its location but once I arrived at my table, I completely understood. The dining room is clean, elegant, and very open but the location (8th floor) provides you with an amazing view of the city.   We chose to go for the lighter version of the tasting menu with wine pairings and there were no regrets. I think we had about 13 delicious courses in total.   This restaurant doesn't just deliver food nor do they just deliver service. Everything that you experience is experienced at another level. Every course was extremely unique but delicious at the same time. The service was impeccable and the pairings were exactly what you wanted.   Near the end of our dining experience we were asked to join them in the kitchen for one of our last courses. We were sat at a table that overlooked the entire kitchen. Then, our course was delivered to us and explained to us by Rasmus Kofoed (Executive chef). We then enjoyed this course while he talked to us about our vacation and our plans - extremely nice guy and a great experience.   After dinner we decided to have some coffee. When it was ready, we were welcomed to the lounge to enjoy it. Once again, another wow moment as you overlook the water and city from a completely different (and stunning) view.   Overall, this restaurant will provide you with an experience that I can almost guarantee you haven't experienced before. We've all had great food and service in a great dining room before but you haven't had Geranium. I wish there was a word that would describe what I'm trying to say...I guess you'll just have to go see for yourself.  Enjoy!","50"
"Bjørn K P","Our first visit to Geranium. The experience started with a perfect pink champagne and the first of 22 trilling examples of nordic inspiered taste, texture and visual combinations. This became a fantastic journey into the culinary universe of Geranium. Our table had a great view into the kitchen so we could see how the finishing touch was added to the dishes. Our dining experience lasted 4 hours and time just disapeared. The service was fantastic too, due to knowledgable servants telling you about the food and the wines ( 10 different ecological wines ).","50"
"shawn b",". Wow. What an epic culinary experience. I have eaten at a few Michelin starred restaurants, but none had the same level of creativity and food wizardry as the geranium. It clearly lives up to its top billing as the most famous and influential restaurant in Denmark .  visited this restaurant for a leisurely dinner on a Friday with my fiance and enjoyed every second of it. The food and service was absolutely first class. The decor and atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect. It is worth the journey over there regardless where in the world you live.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a first class experience and","50"
"batravn","This was my second visit to Geranium in 2 years. The restaurant is still the by far most expensive in Copenhagen (especially if selecting the deluxe wine menu), but in respects of taste it is also - still - at the top of the Copenhagen restaurant scene.   We had tehe 7 course lunch menu, which - in respect of teasing the taste buds - was it little disappointing in one or two courses. However, the ingenuity and quality of this restaurant including the amazing wine pairing still - by far - is worth 5 stars.","50"
"PeteFromDarwin","On the off-chance of snagging a last-minute table, I dropped my name onto Geranium's wait list. The charming and friendly experience began the next morning with a lovely voicemail from Tina who was enthusiastic about our choice to dine at Geranium and offering to arrange us unusual seating by the fire. She told us we'd love it.  A day later, our flight into Copenhagen was running late, but there was no stress at the restaurant where we were greeted with quiet friendliness, relaxing glasses of really excellent champagne and a delightful city view in the lounge.   Even though every table in the restaurant was occupied, when we moved to our spot by the fire offered a feeling of space and intimacy while offering pleasant views of the restaurant, park, and city.  The food was very well paced for us, with knowledgable and friendly staff sharing not just information, but their personal views about the plates, making it a much more friendly and relaxed experience than most other top-flight restaurants that I've tried. The drinks pairings were explained in a no-nonsense way, with no fuss or snobbiness: a great way to be introduced to a few new grape varieties and regions that I'd never tried before.   While 22 courses might seem a little excessive, it was actually quite perfect and we left not only pleasantly full, but still talking about some of the inspired flavour choices, the wonderful flow of dishes and also the beauty of the plating.  If there was any part of the experience that fell a little below the level that we'd already come to expect from Geranium, it was the french press coffee that was served in the lounge after our meal, which was a let down after such a marvellous meal. Perhaps I'm a bit fussy about these things. (I didn't enjoy the espresso at Alinea last time either...)  Thanks Tina and all your colleagues, we did indeed love it!","50"
"SG4FC","I went here with my parents and my partner and we had a truly faultless experience. The progression of dishes from snacks to mains to desserts was like going on a journey or watching a story unfold. Every dish was vibrant and interesting in its experimentation. On top of this the presentation, the atmosphere and the service were all perfect. Further they allowed us to enter the kitchen and watch them work through some of the dinner service. Next Rasmus himself came to our table with one of the dishes and gave us a brief explanation of what influences his dishes. There is no such thing as perfect in the culinary world as each experience is subject to personal opinion but i would say that this place comes pretty close. After comparison I would say that it may have been second to Noma in reaching two stars but I bet it will be the first of the two to reach three. As a side note, the view overlooking the park was great too!","50"
"Trip-Molly86","I went to restaurant Geranium last week and it was a wonderful experience. The surroundings are really beautiful - aesthetic decor and one of the best views in Copenhagen. The menu was perfectly balanced. You can really feel that they've thought of both every single dish and the combination of the dishes all together. Every dish is like a small piece of art, whilst being very tasty at the same time. I also love that you feel satisfied and full after the meal, but not overwhelmingly so, as at so many other gourmet restaurants. All in all, one of the absolute best fine dining restaurants in Europe - especially, for those who love fish, seafood and vegetables.","50"
"Harald Cees C","more people in the kithcen and serving than guests. Very good flow of the dishes, no waiting time. The creations are each one some kind of art for all senses. No bad feelings for choosing the short lunch and cheap juice menu in stead of the wine menu. if you go two you will perhaps have one of the deserts in the kitchen overlooking how they work in the kitchen and have a chat with the staff. Incredible show. Teatre de chef du monde......","50"
"MissHale","I was here with a group of people and we had a very nice dinner here. I did not try the wine, so I cannot put my 2 cents in on that, but the food was very good and the plates/dishes brought out always brought the table to a stand-still to see what was next.  I look forward to a visit again in the future.","40"
"stentoft","If something like “food-orgasm” exists then it was what we got. Simply great! When the starters were served, I thought, that they would break their neck on this, impossible to improve from there, but I was wrong. One dish after the other took us higher and higher. What I like, is that the food is in the centre not the serving and performance around the food. The wines are extremely interesting and I had really an eye opener - the wine from Terra Alta – simply unique. Thanks! In Geranium you get value for money.","50"
"VonGregson","Our dining experience at Geranium was totally amazing. A fantastic 22 course meal where every plate was a delight. The seafood dishes were stunning, all plates were beautiful and really quite fun.   The staff were attentive and I absolutedly LOVED it when the head chef came out to explain a couple of dishes to us. I then couldn't contain my excitement when we were taken into the kitchen to eat one of our desserts. In here you can really see the work that goes into crafting such beautiful dishes - the quality control and perfect attention to detail was obvious. If you can, request a table that looks into the kitchen!   The restaurant itself is pretty stark and bare, lacking a little warmth but this is a small critisism. I wouldn't say it was the most romantic restaurant I've been in.   It is a pricey experience and I have to admit to being slightly overwhelmed at the beginning by everything, but it is worth the money. We did not go for the wine or juice pairing (the latter being c.£70 which just seemed ridiculous), but we had a couple glasses of wine recommended by the staff which were both outstanding and perfectly matched to our courses.   The staff were pretty slow at the end to get our cheque and it took us sometime to get anyone's attention - turns out the machine wasn't working so we did have to queue at the end to pay. There is also an additional charge for credit cards which seems odd. But I did like the little candy gift box at the end.   Brilliant experience and definitely something to do when you want to treat yourselves.","50"
"enseglare","Overall this was a great dinner. The dishes are artistic gems and all with distinct sensations. Winelist was extremely well designed to follow a modern organic line with mostly small producers. Staff, was well trained and personable. The only drawback for me and my party of 10 concurred, was the space. Slightly cold and boring.","40"
"katie528","How can one describe Geranium sufficiently? There are not enough superlatives (at least in the English language)! From start to finish there was (almost) seamless service from this 2* Michelin establishment in Copenhagen. 22 courses flowed like the wine with which each was paired and brought to the table by not only the chic-ly dressed waitstaff but one of the army of chefs who produce the creative dishes of head chef Rasmus. Their pride is evident and they will be as unobtrusive or as engaging as you wish. Our curiosity was always met with an intelligent answer. Food: superb. Service: excellent. Ask for a table where you can see into the kitchen!","50"
"Chris4232","  Before extolling the virtue of Chef Rasmus and his kitchen i need to get a rant over regarding the Sommelier whose attitude and behaviour (not to mention tattoos and piercings) were appalling and completely spoiled what was a magical food event.   My friend (very sound wine expert) questioned her as to why the Tourraine wine which was to accompany three tasting courses was cloudy. Her response was to become immediately aggressive offer a poor explanation about the wine being natural and not manufactured and then argue without listening to the friendly questions being asked. She later re filled two glasses on the table with the same wine from a different bottle ignoring my friend. When asked to re fill his glass she was asked why the same wine was crystal clear her reply before walking away mid question was it is all the same I will give you the producers address and you can take it up with him!  Enough rant but if you are going to rightly claim the plaudits of a two star Michelin you need staff of the right calibre! The tattooed lady let the entire (delightful) team down irrecoverably.  The food - My wife is a vegan and the chefs treated her as if she was a princess rather than a pariah. Each course was tailored for her exquisitely and expertly reflecting the genius of the kitchen and head chef. For us mere mortals every morsel was a culinary triumph of taste and visual gastronomy. Having eaten in Michelin restaurants all over the world this food experience was truly world class and knocks Noma off the top spot, however the attention to detail with the food was not matched by some if the service including using the same wine glasses for new wines!  So in summary truly memorable and expensive eating experience which will feature in social and business conversations for a long time, sadly I suspect the enduring memory will be the appalling Sommelier and not the triumph of the food.    ","50"
"WorldmonkeyLondon","Wonderful food and service over each of 22 courses and - despite significant price tag - very good value for money. Turbot with moss and foamy mayonnaise was particular highlight for me ; the carrot ball and 'baked potato' for my wife.  Personal service from chef Rasmus particularly nice touch, as was the course eaten in kitchen!  Impressive view from unusual premises a few mins from central copenhagen - interesting drive through lovely district.  Reasons why not rated a 5 were:  - bizarre 'extra charge for credit cards' note on menu : not mentioned on Website and echos of Ryanair  - staggeringly high 400 kroner charge for 2 medium size glasses of champagne (beware)  - queue to pay at the desk at the end and my wife very disappointed she was not given the same 'special box'' as the lady in the queue before us!  Otherwise excellent evening and well recommended.","40"

"Tallinda","The experience of this restaurant , often described as second only to Noma, was stunning. From start to finish each course was a taste explosion in an amazing form. The glass wall to the kitchen meant you could view numerous chefs preparing the meal. The staff were friendly and would answer all questions .  Highly recommended!","50"
"David_R_Silva","We had one of our best food experiences? The service is beyond perfection and each dish is harmonized with the perfect wine. Whenever a new dish arrives, it is accompanied by a brief explanation. The food has a very creative looking. The restaurant was quite empty at lunch so we were invited to have dessert in the kitchen. Fantastic.","50"
"restlessbums","22 course meal, which in true Nordic style was extremely fresh and amazing quality.  Enjoyed the experience, although can't say that it blew me away. Having eaten at the Fat Duck, this place was slightly disappointing as it appeared to lack that imagination and creativity that Heston puts into his meals.   The lady who took my reservation was extremely friendly and helpful and made a note to ensure that I was first on the waiting list as it was my husband's birthday. However, the service at the restaurant was mixed. Perhaps, it's because the Danes can appear a bit abrupt in their manner, but that was disappointing. I specifically asked one of the waitresses to bring me still water, and she kept pouring sparkling, which was annoying.   However, a nice touch was that the owner / also considered the best chef in the world for 2012, actually still cooks a lot of the meals! Which means that we managed to get a photo with him.   If you do get a reservation and you happen to be in Copenhagen, then I would recommend it. But otherwise, I don't feel that it was worth flying all the way to Copenhagen for.  Also, it is located near a football stadium, which is quite tricky to get to.","40"
"Kristina009","Amazing food & amazing service. We were quick in and out too, without ruining the experience. Nice atmosphere. In conclusion, top food and top service! Will definitely recommend and go again. They also just received their second Michelin star - well deserved!","50"

"happyed186338","We went there for lunch over the weekend. The food was outstanding as was the service. We had the three hour tasting menu together with the wine paring and it was awesome. Very creative food and perfect presentation.  Highly recommended. Gives Noma a run for its money.","50"
"Lars D","We went there for lunch as dinner was fully booked. We went for shorter testing menu with wines, which lasted 2.5 hours or so. It was simple fantastic. Every little course is a new discovery, both in taste and presentation. Nice touch: they invited us to kitchen to have desert while watching how kitchen works. It is expensive even by Copenhagen standards, but really worth it!","50"
"MarkTluszcz","Had lunch today at Geranium. It was an absolutely fabulous experience....very inventive and every dish is a true discovery. I had read about Scandinavian cuisine, and this place delivered on everything I was expecting. The highlight was smoked turbot and moss. Yes, moss....  This is the type of place for the curious eater. Every dish was an experience in itself.  While they only have 1 Michelin star, they clearly deserve more. Service and ambiance was also excellent. Bravo.","50"
"teskeTeske","This place is an experience - dont come here for large portions or with a large appetite but come here for innovative really different food. The place doesnt look of much from the outside (its placed very strangely in side a football stadion building a bit out side the city center), but in side its very nice and exclusive. Very nice ambience and a nice view. The portions are small and very light but it tastes wonderfull and you can't make this food at home! The service is very good all though for the price you would expect all the waiters to know all about the food - there was a girl who didnt know the details but she and the rest of the staff were very nice. So absolutely worth a visit if you are a foodie but bring a very large purse - I think this restaurant is the most expensive in Copenhagen.","40"
"Erik D","We had a wonderful evening thanks to Magnus and his team. Quality was high from start till the very end, wines where perfectly paired and service was top notch.  I especially liked the oyster-iron-fish roe combination.  Geranium definitely plays in the same league as noma, but their approach is slightly different. While Redezepi and his team at noma are constantly looking for new techiques and ingredients, at Geranium they consolidate these methods and try to refine them further.  Both are interesting and serve great dishes, but in terms of sheer quality, my vote goes to Geranium!","50"
"marcod910","November 30th 2012, lunch.   A nice and funny experience: ligter lunch menu and juice pairing: seaweed chips (good), carrot & seabuchthorn, sea salt cheese & ramson, dried flowers & apple (great), mushrooms, razor clam, jerusalem artichoke tree & walnut oil, burned potato & sheep's milk butter, jellied ham with tomato water & sorrel flowers, dillstone & fermanted vegetables, heather-smokedturbot & moss, bread with emmer & spelt, onions & melted hay cheese, venison with red leaves & stems (very good), elderflower soda (amazing), frozen herb tea & white chocolate, green egg & rustne som. Wide selection of juices.  1 people, about 160 euro. Well, it was not so a large meal as it could seem but was interesting and amusing to try different flavours, textures and presentations, all carefully described by the staff. One of the dishes was served in the cuisine talking with the staff. Great service and great courtesy and availability by all, with the chef serving at tables.  Perhaps just some more ""soul"" in the dishes lacks to the excellence.  Anyway, thank you all.","40"
"Westlife25","This is a gastronomic fairytal. This is much more than eating.We were 4 friends and had booked a table some months in advance. The restaurant is not in the city center and we took a taxi to Parken. The surroundings weren`t that nice, but once we got in to the restaurant it was all forgotten. A lovely warm and modern restaurant with open kitchen. We got first a glass of champagne and then the fairytale started. We got 21 different dishes, all of them like small art objects accombined with very good wines. We stayed for almost 5 hours and loved every second of it.  Love to come back!","50"
"JacquelineB228","The location at the National Football Stadium is odd, but once there you are greeted in a sophisticated, yet welcoming dining room. Your preprandial drink (we had a wonderful dark pink Champagne) is accompanied by small bites which set the tone for the evening. The presentation is exquisite. A lot of beautifully polished stones and small branches softening the clean lines of the dining room. Our table for 4 was close to the open kitchen and we could see the chef and assistants carefully placing ingredients on ever changing china as the courses went one after the other. Each course is just a few bites, but I was struggling to finish by the end of the evening. Among my favorites: a bubble of dill essence and frozen white chocolate snow. A few nits: there was too much moss with the halibut seviche and a couple of salads are repetitive. Service was more attentive at the beginning of the evening that when all tables became occupied. Because the courses are small, service is required at a greater rate that in a more traditional meal and there just weren't enough bodies. All in all, a worthwhile experience.","40"
"jasonLisboa","1º Prices and set menu: All the prices are on their website and they answered to to my question by e-mail. So you know before you get there what to expect  2º Staff: I don´t know if I was very lucky (considering some bad reviews about this) but the staff that was there on the 3th November at lunch time was very friendly. Some inexperience mistakes for a world class restaurant but very friendly.  3º the food: Overall is look over flavour but even so the food tastes very good. unfortunately I have to say I´ve missed that one dish that could make cry for more and be in my memory forever. Probably at dinner we can have this with the chef most famous dish.  4º Wine pairing: Obscene price. It was 1700DKK for person but we had a wonderful spanish red wine for 1000DKK/bottle.  Overall this is a very good restaurant, with nice view, nice staff, relax atmosphere, very good food (my favorites: Burned Potato & Sheep´s milk butter, Lobster and Frozen Herb tea & white chocolate).  The meal was 485€ for two persons which we thought it was a fair price.  If ever return to Copenhagen I went there for dinner BUT will stay away from the wine pairing. This place is not for just a meal It´s a wonderful experience.","40"
"Reinholdt","Geranium is situated in a corner of the Danish National Football (soccer) Stadium, PARKEN. That doesn’t sound like the obvious spot for a world class restaurant. Nevertheless Geranium last year entered the top 50 on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list.  We stepped out of the elevator on the top floor and the view was stunning. Both the restaurant and the view over Copenhagen was exceptional. As soon as we walked in to the restaurant the world’s best chef (winner of the Bocuse d’Or 2011) Rasmus Kofoed welcomed us.  The seating at Geranium is really comfortable around nice big tables (a size you rarely see at modern restaurants).  The 22 servings were accompanied by 10 great wines (champagne + wine menu). My wife had the juice menu - 9 different juices. They were great too and accompanied the food as well as the wine.  During one of the servings we were seated in the middle of the kitchen (this is optional but highly recommendable). All members of the staff welcomed us at the kitchen - and it was quite an experience.  Four hours later we left restaurant after a mind-blowing experience.  If Geranium is not in top 10 next time the World's Best Restaurants list is publicized something is definitely rotten in the state of Denmark ...","50"
"Jill S","Had dinner in October with my family. The originality and quality of he food made for a fun evening. However, the service went from attentive in the beginning of the 20 course meal to being ignored by the end. The chef and staff were focused on people who must been regulars, chatting and inviting them into the kitchen, while we literally just sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our final course and then to be given a check. As well, we were on a two week trip through Europe, ate at many of the finest restaurants in Copenhagen, Rome and Positano and this was by far the most expensive. In retrospect, $500 per person just wasn't worth it and I wish I had done better research before choosing the restaurant. I would think twice before committing to the wine pairing which basically doubled the price of the meal. Perhaps it is a better choice for lunch.","30"
"MansoorMirza","The only mistake we did was that despite a clear polite warning while booking for a dinner, we had 4 kids (8-11 years) with us. The place is gorgeous. Staff is friendly. Over twenty courses of some of fabulous nordic art with great wine to follow.  After a daylong symposium we were exhausted and unfortunately could not hold our heads up and decided to drop the last three courses. I would love to come back to this greatest place!","50"
"marcelo_m304560","Second time very very diferent, not so much the food or the menu but the service, wine pairing and last not the least the ambiance. My previous time the service and waiters where, very nice, friendly mixing a kind of exotic south flavour, mainly because I met a portugueses water very professional, and last time i just saw sad and unhappy people. Why did wine pairing changed so much? Why did wine presentation changed radically? Big surprise for the best 49th. I´ll check another time just to see","20"
"Andy C","Challenging, enlightening, intelligent cooking, perfectly executed and served. The best presentation I have had anywhere in the world. On top of a football stadium. Lunch with 2 glasses of wine around 100 euros and worth more. Almost empty on a Friday lunchtime, whilst I'm sure Noma was packed out. I prefer this place. Wherever you live in the world, if you really love serious food you should make the effort to come to this restaurant.","50"
"MillionsRoadWarrior","We had the chance to eat here at their new location in the Parken (before a Football match). This is an amazing restaurant. It is a delightful sensory workout and every little detail is thought of in this paean to molecular gastronomy.","50"
"BillR2390","My two friends from Denmark joined me for dinner at Geranium the day after we all had lunch together at Noma. Without question, we all slightly preferred dinner at Geranium over lunch at Noma--though recognizing the challenge in comparing dinner and lunch. However, unquestionably, our dinner and the premium wine pairing at Geranium qualifies as one of the 2 or 3 best meals in my life.   I've dined at any number of 1, 2, and 3 Michelin star restaurants throughout the world, including the French Laundry in Napa, Le Bernadin and Eleven Madison Park in New York, Atelier de Joel Rubochon and Guy Savoy in Paris, etc. In my opinion, Geranium absolutely deserves its place among them (and Noma!).   First, the food was extraordinary--and just as with Noma, unquestionably the most experimental meal I've yet tried. If you don't like unusual and intriguing, this isn't for you. To me, the fact that Geranium served raw mackerel, which I despise, and paired it with a horseradish unlike any I've ever tried (and which I also despise), and made the dish delicious to me is sheer genius. I can't even begin to describe how the wine pairing made the whole thing work beyond my wildest dreams, as well.   I did have trouble with the oyster dish, as I absolutely have been unable to take oysters since I was a child. But I tried them. Not my cup of tea, but they in no way diminished my complete love of my meal in any way. That's an impressive feat, as many of my previous restaurant reviews can prove.   Second, the wine pairings were absolute genius. It was pricey beyond pricey and worth EVERY penny. With the possible sole exception of my other favorite meal and wine pairings at Cyrus in Healdsburg, CA, several years ago, Geranium's wine pairings were likely the best I've ever had--and these with the most bizarre dishes I've ever had for dinner.   Third, the service was very good, though I would give the overall nod to Noma here. We had a slightly off start with a woman who came off brusque and short. But we ended up with a WONDERFUL woman named Christina who was among the team serving our table (perhaps it became obvious that we weren't fond of the other woman). Christina was an absolute delight, and once she and her colleagues served our table, our service seemed more appropriate for the occasion. Overall, service was very good, but we would say there was a slight uncertainty or lack of confidence/experience on the part of some team members in their approach compared to having seen utter perfection in service at Noma.  Finally, I loved the Danish tradition of casual elegance. Dress varied from smart casual (me!) to a jacket and tie and much in between. As a total foodie who detests pretense, I loved it. We all found the restaurant to be modern and more elegant than Noma but absolutely lovely and without pretense.   In the end, it was super pricey--my premium wine pairing costing more than the actual meal! But it was worth it again. Sheer brilliance. Geranium and Cyrus will go down as the 2 most impressive and favorite meals of my lifetime.","50"
"hgr020","This is a difficult one, but positives first: Overall very well presentation of food, and a few outstanding dishes - including some of the snack .   However too many things were just too similar. A soup or stock or fond to pour over some ""food stuff"" in the bottom of a dish turns out to be a bore once you try it 5-6 times in the same menu,..while I think that the restaurant pursue both nordic cuisine and molecular cuisine it seem to fail to deliver very well on both.   Wine menu was daring and experimental...this goes well in some cases, others not - I did not feel they hit the mark. Services were just...not good. Too busy, too inexperienced, too arrogant, too not caring. I am yet to figure out which it was.   Once you sit there you feel something is missing. once you see the bill, you know you didn't get what you paid for. That was our unfortunate experience. The whole experience was just not close to the experience we had for similar priced restaurants.   I had better food, service and wine in both areas in other restaurants in both copenhagen and elsewhere in Europe.I would not return.","20"
"CyclingPig","We had a wonderful evening at Geranium. They serve nordic food, and sometimes it gets a bit to cold and untasty.   BUT - everything is perfectly prepared and they fully deserve their Michelin-star. As a chef I got some mindblowing experiences, and that is what I expect, when I visit a place like Geranium.   Don't expect the normal style. They do things differently. Only one out of 9 vines on the menu was red.  Overall a magical night, where I got blown away by at least 3-4 dishes. The rest of the dishes where perfect, but not mindblowing:)  Enjoy.","40"

"Kellykbhv","Geranium restaurant is located at Parken stadium, and not at all what I expected. The interior is calm and relaxing and the view is unbroken over Copenhagen. The food, we had the taster menu, what can I say, every single course was truly amazing. Carrots that tasted so sweet (and in no way resembled carrots), cheese crisp, tiny bread pieces that were so soft and light, oysters that just tasted of the seaside (perfect) I could go on. We even got to sit in the kitchen for a course and chat to the chef, (the kitchen was so organized and also calm), it made the day even more memorable. Wines were excellent, staff very attentive. Loved it...  (one thing.... some hand cream in the bathrooms) ;)","50"

We´re from Barcelona and felt in Geranium the best of the best. The service also very  friendly even with spanish speaking waiter helping to a better wine paring understanding. Already working on a group of friends to came back.  Carlos Martinez","50"
"Rick E","I attended Geranium for a private function, so the staff had the challenge of serving world class cuisine to a hundred or so guests. Nevertheless I could find nothing to fault. 6 courses, each highly imaginitive, and each course served with a different wine perfectly matched to the food.  What sets a restaurant of this standard apart is attention to detail. Intricate carving of the smoked salmon starter or the blackberry on top of dessert. And for me, Geranium excels in achieving subtlety of flavour, where some upmarket restaurants try to pack in flavour to the point where it can be overpowering.  If I were to search for fault, perhaps the location is inconvenient, but once there you find yourself perched on top of the football stadium with stunning views over the city.  Without doubt, one of the best restaurants I have eaten in, and an experience to remember.","50"

"twise99","yes it was expensive, but after having eaten in many top restaurants in the world, geranium takes the cake for best service, most imaginative and a highly fresh and tasty culinary experience. i suggest going for lunch where it is cheaper and easier to get in. they tout the views, which i found so-so (who wants to look at power plant stacks all lunch?). but, you cannot beat the interior ambiance. again, bring the credit card!","50"
"Sibylly","Geranium offers an eclectic and inventive menu that showcases the creative potential of its head chef who was nice enough to serve us during our 4 hour dinner. A subtle 'geranium' theme percolates throughout his dishes with nice herbal accents of thyme, ramson, dill, chevril, and rosemary which is reminiscent of the vegetal, minty and slightly peppery aroma of the geranium flower.   The seafood dishes were masterly composed and delightful. The unami of the king crab appetizer was enhanced by smoked cream cheese and the lobster main course was paired with a beet root gelee that brings out the lobster's natural sweetness. The menu can benefit from from a smoother progression of flavors especially at the beginning when we started our snacks. We were provided with some seaweed chips followed by a sea buck thorn/carrot capsule which was bizarrely sweet yet delicious. However it seemed more like a dessert than a snack and combined rather strangely with the previous seaweed taste of the chips. This was followed some lovely crackers of sea salt cheese and ramson but right afterwards we were served a rather sour apple and celeriac roll which nullified the pleasant salty taste of the crackers. Then came some rather dry 'bark' & goat cheese crunchy chips which didn't taste like anything and managed only to demonstrate the kitchen's ability to replicate the flavor and texture of bark. The final snack, a jerusalem artichoke 'tree' which was just two deep friend slivers of the root vegetable hung on a tangle of twisted branches tasted bland and overrated.  That said, the rest of the menu was quite good, especially the lobster and oyster main courses. Apart from the mismatched progression of flavors which seemed a bit out of place during the initial snack stage of the meal, the rest of the dishes were innovative and inspired. However, it is essential to get the snacks right since they are served at the beginning of the meal to entice the guest to imagine what delightful dishes may come after. The desserts could also use some fine tuning for consideration. We received a elderflower foam with berry flavored gelee for palette cleaser but for our final dessert we were also served a simple parsley root ice cream topped with more roasted shavings of crunch parsley root which had such strong clean celery root flavor that it tasted more like what a palette cleanser should be. This last dessert was one-dimensional in flavor and completely lacked the nuanced subtlety of the main courses which impressed us.  Therefore, we can only give this place 4 stars despite all of its great qualities. However, we still highly recommend this restaurant and believe it has exceptional potential.","40"
"TAtonull","Flew down here to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and we could not be more happy with our choice (everyone goes to Noma these days, so we thought we give the challenger a chance).  When we arrived in our taxi there were no football match so the taxi driver could take us all the way to the door, no problems like one unlucky other reviewer wrote (who by the way seemed to have a bad day).   We were taken directly to our table and the chairs were comfortable - even for my pregnant girlfriend. We decided to go for the full tasting menu and due to my girlfriends pregnancy we both took the non-alcohol choice. None of us regretted that, they had put quite some effort into making their own juices for each and every course - some really experimental one as well - a different and interesting experience instead of the usually wine menu.  The food is like most reviewers write (besides one grumpy one) experimental and just lovely. We do our 20 Michelin stars a year, but this was one of the best experiences we have had for a while. The price? A bit stiff, but then again, you invest in quality.  Service and atmosphere: The place was stylish with most dressed in black, however the staff and people seemd relaxed and not one of those library silence places, so you can speak with your normal voice.  Highly recommended!","50"
"fublife","Having looked forward to the unique experience of dining here (my meal was, after all, going to be prepared under the supervision of the world’s greatest chef), I was – as hinted by my headline – absolutely underwhelmed.   Though arriving in a cab, we have to walk the last 100 metres to the restaurant. We simply cannot get any closer because a quite insignificant match between two Danish football teams is about to begin. Thus, our cab cannot take us to the entrance of the restaurant, and we have no other option than walking the rest of the way – surrounded by convivial football fans. I, for one, was certainly relieved that, this day, both fan groups were of a good-humoured and easygoing disposition.  Upon arrival, you are shown to a seat in the restaurant lounge where you are obliged to remain seated for 45 minutes for the purpose of deciding whether you want one or the other menu whilst being served diminutive snacks accompanied by a glass of bubbly. In my view, 45 minutes is stretching it a bit far especially when, as was the case, your guest is practically blinded by the sun – a fact escaping the notice of our waiter. Hence, in my book, the restaurant is already losing on points.   Finally shown to our table where, once again, I was blinded by the sun and as, once again, this went unnoticed by our waiter I had to draw the curtain myself, before we were ready for our glorious meal.  I will not comment on the individual courses, but just describe our meal as a whole. Here, I will characterise the visual presentation as a 5-star experience, whereas taste-wise, I cannot go higher than 3 stars. Similar to practically every other Danish restaurant nowadays, Geranium is making a mint out of the Nordic theme; and 70-80% of the menu is taken up by vegetables – accompanied by a smattering of fish and a bit of chicken. I am becoming increasingly fed up with the Nordic theme, as there are limits as to how many times you can set the Thames on fire (or the Copenhagen Channel, for that matter). Thus, there are limits as to how many different ways you can make root vegetables tasty.  The wines served are all chosen by the restaurant itself; and they are all either organic or biodynamic. And, well yes, I can follow that they are particularly selected for the food. However, fine-flavoured is not the term I would use in this connection. Never before have I risen from my dinner leaving so many half-emptied glasses behind.  At a price of DKK 3,300 per head, then food, wine and serving must be perfect. Anything less, is cheating – from my point of view. I am well aware that chef Kofoed himself believes his food to be fantastic; and, therefore, he does not consciously intend to cheat. That does not, however, mean that I don’t feel cheated; and not even if my meal was being paid for me, would I feel inclined to dine there again. For the wines are unsatisfying; and – albeit visually a masterpiece – the food is tame in taste; and the service is inattentive.  Finally, let me remind my readers, that I am not by profession a food critic. I’m just a layman eating out 3 times a week – in Denmark, as abroad. And, yes, I have been to some of the world’s greatest restaurants, around the globe; but, when all is said and done, this does not make me an expert.","30"
"Buddy67","Probably one of the best Restaurants in the World. Master Chef Rasmus Kofoed won the world championship in France in 2011, and now i know why :-), I can definitely recommend this place.","50"
"Rawlpluks","This restaurant is an experience but not for everyone. For one, as the restaurant of ""the best chef in the world"", expect to pay the same as a weekend trip to Paris. Second, the food is modern/experimental and not to something to be taken lightly. When this is said, GO THERE. Like other reviewers I have also dined at Noma and other comparable places but Geranium is an experience. The access is by elevater in one of the corner towers at the danish national stadium, not the place you would expect to find a world class restatrant. Architecture (by Space who also did Noma, I like this better) is elegant, dark with a distinct nordic touch. Service is impeccable, not in any way snobish but very friendly and informative. Starters are taken in the lounge and is a part of the experience. As such, there is no real main course, and bread is served as a single course! I have never before or since tasted potatose cooked in the manner i experienced at Geranium. Giving a more detailed description of the food is difficult, like the Matrix, you can only experience it for yourself :) If you are really lucky you get (or reserve) the corner table near the open glass door/windows that allows you to watch the preparation of the food. Notice the silence in the kitchen! I have only visited during the winter and i am curious to see how the experience is during the spring/summer with more light/heat comming through the large windoareas.","50"

"ccthevet","After having pre-ordered the ""large"" menu including the wine menu I was quite disappointed to realize that this dinner consisted of only a long row of appetizers - (read: very small portions) with only tiny amounts of meat (chicken/mackerel/Norway lobster) ... and I did absolutely not intend to go vegan. Moreover the ""wine"" menu included several types of beer and ciders ... things you can a lot cheaper in almost any cafe in Copenhagen.

"batravn","Having been to Noma just 2 months previously we had a chance to make a direct comparision between the two most hyped and celebrated restaurants and head chefs in Copenhagen: Rene Redzipi as no. 1 on the Pellegrini Worlds Best Restaurants list vs. Rasmus Kofoed, winner of the Bocuse D'or competion.  Lets just jump to the conclusion: With regard to taste Geranium is a notch ahead of Noma, but Noma is a notch ahead of Geranium with respect of being a complete dining experience.  As stated in previous reviews the location of Geranium is peculiar: The entrance is at ground level of an office tower of the Copenhagen football stadium. Not very fancy. But once you get to the restaurant on 8th. floor, the views over the adjacent park, the harbour area and to Sweden are spectacular. The restaurant itself is elegant and minimalisticly decorated with a simplistic cozy ambience.  We had the 7 course dinner (after just as many snacks) and the luxury wine pairing. The dinner was of absolute world class, with the focus of the modern nordic cuisine on local produce, but with a slight more focus on taste than on surprice and awe as at Noma. The wine pairing was the most exciting, original and best wine selection I've ever had at any restaurant, with a focus on (the best of the best) German wines.  A close to perfect meal and a perfect wine pairing. However, everything comes with a price. The tab was at DKK 3400 per person (including wine pairing), which is USD 650 at the current exchange rate. That is by far the most expensive menu in Copenhagen and at this price the experience has to be perfect every time!","50"
"ChrisA9","We had the 7 course menu with one bottle of wine (we couldn't afford the wine pairing which would have cost the same as the food) and the juice pairing which we shared between 3 of us. We did have the extra cheese course, plus one extra glass of red wine to go with the meat course and the bill came to £200 each. I've never had such an expensive meal, but the meal took 3 1/2 hours and I didn't regret spending so much in one evening. My criticism would be that I thought the juice was too expensive especially as they weren't exactly generous with their servings. I thought the food was wonderful, each dish very well presented, tasting exquisite and always with an interesting combination of flavours. I loved the high quality of the decor and the general calm and peaceful ambiance. It's an interesting location on the 8th floor of a modern building with views out over the Baltic. To fit in with the quality of the food and the expensive feel of the place I would have liked the waiting staff to have been a bit more refined and classy -better fitting uniforms! They were very friendly though and made us a feel at ease.","50"
"Yomura","Our Danish friends organised this meal after we discussed Noma in length during our meal at el Bulli. They argued that they prefered Geranium to Noma and that we had to try it - I didn't quite expect them to get a table two days after our discussion and we found ourselves flying to Copenhagen for a meal a couple of months later.  The location of the restaurant is interesting. It's in the middle of a park at the top floor of a concrete building. The entrance downstairs is elegant and simple. I had some reservations as to the venue but all my doubts were dispelled as soon as we arrived to the top floor.  The restaurant is very simple and elegant. There's a bar area with a flame that goes on all evening inside a glass box. The restaurant makes good use of their view over the park and the surrounding neighbourhood.  The food in general is quite similar to Noma. It focuses heavily on seasoned vegetables and seafood. We only had one course with meat but we actually enjoyed this more! I guess what separates Geranium from Noma is that Geranium incorporates more molecular cuisine techniques found in other establishments like Fat Duck or el Bulli.   If there's any fault to be found, it would be perhaps on the service. Don't get me wrong, the service was great and better than most places I've been to. However, comparing it to other competitors like Noma or el Celler de Can Roca, there's perhaps a little bit more refinement to be made as we were occasionally interrupted in the middle of a conversations by the waiter/sommelier whilst one probably could have waited a few more seconds to let us finish our phrase. I will admit though that that was the only small fault we could find for the evening.  The wine was chosen well and my partner enjoyed her matching juice which went down like a treat. We had sat down for a 6 hour meal and didn't notice this as we were having so much fun.  Now for the bill... it's definitely not one of the cheapest meals I've ever had and perhaps was more pricey than Noma but that was perhaps because we had the full blown universe menu, matching drinks and a bottle of champagne to start with.   I'd definitely recommend this place to other people who love seafood. You won't be disappointed!","50"
"AllanM81","My wife and I had the best experience on geranium.  We have now visited some top restaurants around Europe, I must say if not geranium get at least two stars on 16 of marts 2011, there is no justice in the world.  We chose the total universe and with 19 servings (including snack), I must say that I was deeply impressed I thought the wines were well chosen and provide complementary food incredibly well, without in any way to overshadow the small masterpieces as Mr. Kofoed and team could created.  Last but not least, we were also lucky enough to see the kitchen and wine cellar (room).  Have the opportunity to visit geranium thought I should do it. It is a great experience.","50"
