"peugeot307","I was staying in Copenhagen just for one evening, so spent some time choosing the restaurant and booked a table couple days in advance. This was the best combination of reasonable price and high rating - and I was happy with my choice, it is actually an amazing value. Had a 6 course dinner without wine pairing, just couple glasses of wine. All dishes were cooked super-nicely, and I liked in particular the sauces that were coming with them, they take the taste to a different level. Would give to all the courses served, especially liked trout for a started and the main of a lamb cooked for 10-12 hours at 52 degrees. just excellent dinner and doesn’t make you feel super full, so it’s a good balance of quantity, not easy to achieve. Highly recommend.","50"
"madhulikag2016","Loved the service , ambience , attention to details. As a vegetarian, I had mentioned while booking on TheFork app that I don't eat egg, meat and fish . We called on day of reservation to make sure of the reservation and they said they were very ready to attend to me which my food specifications. We decided to go with the 4 course option with no wine pairing as I only drink sparkling wine . Loved the first 2 course - first course was zucchini swirls in a amazing cucumber sauce and second course was artichoke -crunchy and out of this world . The main course was disappointing in terms of quantity-was 2 stalks of brocolini and some kale. I don't think 2 stalks of brocolini was a good satisfying substitute for lamb which was the non vegetarian option.the dessert was all right. The experience was overall good . With 2 glasses of wine each with 4 course it came to around 215 usd .","40"
"fillllllll","This was a delicious meal in a delightful atmosphere. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Food was top notch. Quite a lot of wine, six large glasses, all very tasty.","50"
"97maartenb","This is the third time in three years that I ended up having dinner here, and Marv & Ben truly keep up the excellence I learned to appreciate so well! Surprising, excellent combinations of food, pairde with beautiful wines, and this all presented im a very welcoming way, even the temperature of wine and food is spot on - every sip and every bite! Looking forward to next time I in town :-)","50"
"Pjverlinden","What a fantastic restaurant and delicious dinner! We selected the 6-course menu with wine pairing. Every dish was absolutely delicious. We particularly liked the Jerusalem artichoke and the trout with German turnip and cockles broth. The wine matching was excellent. We particularly liked the Hess Cabernet Sauvignon. Wine quantity was very large. :) The service was perfect. Nothing negative to say.","50"
"Bloemski","Last March my family and I spent a few days in Copenhagen to visit our son, who is studying there. Since we are all foodies, I booked two restaurants for the two evenings there. First was popular Marv &Ben, which is lauded not only in the Michelin Guide, but is also elsewhere indicated a “must”. During the reservation process it was clear that we were lucky to get a spot at 18:30 and in the e-mail confirmation they were very clear that our table would be needed at 20:30. This is something that one observes more frequently these days, only the French or the really high end restaurants realize that good food is something that should take time to truly enjoy, relax, sit back and really enjoy all the good things that the kitchen took some much effort to prepare for you, the guest. These days, unfortunately, one apparently needs to feel lucky to “get in” and try what is on offer.  At the Airport, right before boarding our flight to Copenhagen, the restaurant called me to confirm. Again, it was firmly, but kindly stated that they needed the table at 20:30. That evening we had an absolutely lovely and inventive meal at Marv&Ben. Staff was very, very kind and friendly. Only thing that we noticed is that wines were extremely expensive. Of course there are differences between Holland and Denmark, but we drank a Gruner Veltliner that we know fairly well for about 300% of the price we are used to. But still: Denmark. Truly, it was lovely, but.... due to the time slot arrangement they uphold, we were rushed though this lovely menu that deserved more time to truly appreciate. At 20:20, whilst shoveling a pretty and refined dessert (what a waste), we were actually informed that we just had another 10 minutes before we had to leave the table.  This is what is wrong nowadays, there is no fault for the lovely people who work there, each and everyone professional and friendly, the kitchen staff inventive, modern and creative, but it felt like we were there for the restaurant, not the other way around. Just a waste to rush so much quality... Apparently that is the norm nowadays, so sad...  ","40"
"Salamno","The food is a surprise, the way the ingredients are combined and the nice way it is presented. We enjoyed the evening a lot over a tasting menu which held a lot of pleasant surprises for our taste buds. The staff was friendly and relaxed despite the fully booked venue.","50"
"TomS879","First night out in Copenhagen and happily satisfied with this restaurant. Magnificent service, great atmosphere and perfect food! The dishes kept on coming at a fantastic pace, tastes that really were perfect combinations of texture, ingredients and acidity! Not to be missed. Congratulations!","50"
"MurraighMcDonald","You definitely should eat here.  Fantastic contemporary food. The '4 Favourites' is great value considering the quality of the dishes. The setting is nice and relaxed, the service is friendly yet very professional.  Each course was well presented and delicious with varying tastes and textures. They would stand up on the 2 Michelin star menus that I've had.  My only disappointment was that I was dining alone.","50"
"IckFick","My first night in Copenhagen and I booked a table online based on TA reviews and also it is not far from my hotel. From the first greeting when I entered to when I left, I felt so welcomed there by young, energetic and knowledgeable staff. They were so nice and attentive. But the food was amazing! I took the 6 course tasting (it seems there are 4 and 6 course options) with wine pairing. The food was creative, local and presented in interesting ways but it was also delicious. Wines were thoughtfully paired and generously poured and each dish and glass of wine were described in detail. It was one of my best dining experiences in a long time. Not cheap but well worth every krone! I highly recommend for the food, the staff and the overall experience.","50"

"sjam2014","Great little gem in one of the oldest streets of Copenhagen. Would highly recommend the “4 favourites” tasting menu as well as going for the “snacks” (amuse bouche) with a cocktail. The waiters are all knowledgable about each dish which is presented to you as it is delivered to the table. We had to ask for the wine list which is very extensive but it came with some lovely recommendations.","50"
"PerPleksus","Had the 6-course , and the food was superb, especially the second course with Jerusalem artichoke and lovage cured with flounder, it was an explosion of tastes. Great wine and excellent service. We'll be back.","50"
"Eduard P","We visited Marv & Ben last weekend with friends for an early dinner and choose the four course menu inclusive wine pairing, the price was 800,- DKK per person and it was worth the money. It was no problem to swap courses, such as having two starters instead of a dessert. The staff was exceptionally friendly, flexible and and very accomodating, the small restaurant is really worth a visit.","50"
"kie72","Went to this restaurant last night on our quick visit in Copenhagen and we are blown away by the food and friendly service. No long queue or difficult process of booking... everything was prompt, friendly and very attentive (which could be another story if you dine in London's top restaurants for example). The food - as expected - were superb. The homemade bread stole the show and we had two bowls of them. We ordered Four Favourites Tasting Menu and each of them was special. Perhaps less blown away with the dessert (caramelized apple) but very pleased with the grilled pork and the Jerusalem Artichoke with the crispy filling. I'm not sure if this place has already got a Michelin star but is definitely worth at least one! If I have to give a little criticism... that would be the somewhat depressing interior. Perhaps it's just the typical Scandinavian 'clean-lined' style that didn't sit well with me personally... but I'd appreciate more comfortable seating and beautiful props. Just a thought.","50"
"JamesCMcC","We had the snacks to start and snacks they were. One of the snack which was given a long and complicated description tasted just like salad cream! We followed this by the Four favorites. The stand out dishes were the trout and the artichoke. All the food was beautifully presented and the staff were all excellent.","40"
"BroshNissimov","We had an amasing menu dinner (six courses). The food was tasty, delicate, original and surprising. There was use of original herbs and spices that we did not expect. The staff was very friendly, informal and attentive.  My partnet who has celiac disease was very well taken care of, with dishes adapted to be gluten free with no annoying compromises that you usually get elsewhere. There was even a very good gluten free bread that was freshly baked for him.","50"
"Gem7Ger","I had the pleasure of visiting my favourite restaurant in Copenhagen again this week and as usual was not disappointed. The food is simply stunning! Creative delicious and the tasting menu is paired with the perfect wines. The staff are amongst the best I’ve seen : smart; attentive and knowledgable about the dishes and the wines. I honest cannot recommend Marv and Bens highly enough. I must do in any trip to Copenhagen.","50"
"JulesVerneJr","Dined here recently with some family and dear Danish friends in a private room. From the moment we arrived, throughout all of the wonderful courses, and upon the completion of our dining experience, the staff at Marv & Ben (especially Alex) made us feel special. We all had the six-course menu and the food was simply exquisite. While I have been blessed to eat in some wonderful restaurants in my life, Marv & Ben combined service and gastronomy with the best of them. If you are truly looking for an enchanted dining experience in a wonderful city like Copenhagen, go to Marv & Ben's. I look forward to returning there on my next trip to Denmark!","50"
"chicagoshamrock","I am amazed this little place doesn’t have a Michelin star. The quality of the food, presentation, and service were better than many other places I’ve tried who do have stars. They had 4 and 6 course options for meals, wine pairings, and options for cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks. Really nice staff in a cozy atmosphere (the restaurant was converted from an apartment). Online booking was super easy from their website. Some folks were dressed up, others more casual in jeans and sweaters, so ties/jackets definitely not required. Highly recommend for a delicious meal. Cool bonus is their kitchen is right next to the entrance so you can see what the chefs and cooks are doing when you walk in!","50"
"Manchester2006","Great little restaurant - You must book well in advance. Great location, Great food and Great service - Expensive but worth it - A must visit when you are in Copenhagen!","50"
"drjan2016","I was fortunate to dine here as part of a business group dinner. The arrangement was that we would have the five-course degustation. Being a vegetarian, I was a little concerned that they wouldn’t be able to cater for me, but my fears were groundless.   I cannot imagine a better degustation. Starting with the most amazing bread straight out of the oven, with whipped butter, I had to force myself not to eat it all to leave room for the rest of the food.   Everything about the evening was perfect. The food is divine, in taste, texture pairings and presentation. The service was wonderful, friendly and informative. The ambience is delightful.  Go to Copenhagen just to dine here.   ","50"
"Helen J","We visited Marv & Ben and had the four course menu with paired wines (and a sneaky cheese plate with paired port!). The food was absolutely delicious. I'm still torn as to whether the pork or the artichoke plate was my favourite! The service was incredibly friendly and informative with regards to the wine. A fantastic meal and we're so happy to have eaten here. Thank you!","50"
"G544NUbobp","I’ll put it simply - the best non-starred place we have ever been. The service is amazing and we had some fun chats with Alex the co owner. We had the “four favourites” menu, all of which was amazing. However the absolute standout dish was the Jerusalem artichoke, which was paired perfectly. True one bite jaw dropping awesomeness! The Sourdough bread was also an absolute knockout (yes i am reviewing bread, it was that good). And all amazing value for money. This is not a case of you must visit here if you are in Copenhagen, this is a case of you must travel to Copenhagen just to eat here!","50"
"Karen C","I dined here by myself in January and had the most wonderful dinner. Just through a Google search for where to eat while my husband was at a work dinner, I came upon this restaurant and stopped in. They were full downstairs, but so kindly told me I could eat in the upstairs dining room. I had the place to myself and the attention of my delightful waitress, Isolde. I decided on the 4 course tasting menu was was thrilled with each bite. I also did the wine pairing and it was definitely worth it. Isolde even switched out my sweet dessert option for a delicious cheese sampling. Cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.","50"
"garybV1402XZ","My wife and I dined here on my birthday. The food was excellent (if a little pricey). The service was also very good with the waiter having a good knowledge of the dishes etc. We would recommend having the wine pairing menu as it makes a huge difference to the experience.","50"

"Steve B","Went for the extra 3 starter option and thought ok bit average not a lot of flavour they need to work on these then we started on the tasting menu it got better and better. We also took the wine flight not vintage wines but my goodness exceptional flavour which shows it’s not just about age. Without trying to suggest we are food critics which we are not or that we spend our time hopping from star to star we have had some great meals and some very average star meals and we can tell you this un stared restaurant blew many one stared restaurants which we have been to clean out the water. Some very cleaver up stream selling but not without worth. Good job guys!","50"
"CharlieB335","So my husband and I were searching for somewhere to eat on the final night of our weekend away. After being disappointed at lunchtime (as we tried to get a table at another restaurant which was fully booked) we decided to book Marv & Ben for the evening . We arrived in trepidation not knowing what to expect, but after waiting for a few minutes we were put at ease, with an offer of drinks ‘whilst we wait’ as our table wasn’t quite ready (on the house). My husband opted for beer whilst my choice of Prosecco was soon replaced by a glass of champagne. We hadn’t read the reviews so we started to read, ‘overpriced’ ‘not enough food’ ‘pretentious over priced’ amongst the excellent reviews. We were shown to our table, which was by the window on top of the radiator, as it was quite warm we asked for the heating to be turned down which it was and then our Marv & Ben experience began. We chose the 4 course with wine course which didn’t disappoint. The scallops to star were delicate yet punching with flavour. The lovage dish was delightfully delicious. The pork was out of this world ( I’m not a pork fan) & the dessert, I actually had more than a spoonful ( I never eat dessert). Alex the Somenier (love the broach) was very informative and friendly ( knew his stuff!). The staff cannot do enough for you, the service is formidable. A must dine for all you connoisseurs/ foodies ..... thank you Marv & Ben you made our night one we will not forget.","40"

I’m someone who is fairly health conscious and felt like this place just gets it. They blend flavors perfectly and use a lot of fermented foods. Fermented food promotes healthy gut bacteria and overall health! Their bred was also a big hit. It’s sourdough bread made with bone marrow!! It was so tasty and also suitable for people with a gluten intolerance. Not only were the food & cocktails amazing but they really understand health and flavors in a way that most restaurants don’t. This meal and experience was worth every penny! Thanks for a good night out with my husband!","50"
"YYB39","We arrived for a b-day dinner with high expectations following the reviews we have seen. I’m glad to say they were fulfilled:)  The restaurant is a two stories place. while the kitchen and some dinning is on the lower floor the second is only for dining, and tables are organized in three rows. Decor is simple with nice dim warm light, and if you can get a table near the window than it would definitely boost the romantic environment.  We had the complete tasting menu including the wine pairing. Dinner pass was relaxed and allowed us to enjoy each dish. Wine pairing was good with nice selection of different types and region wines, portions were generous and we even got some refills for one that we really liked.  The food was excellent and surprising and cooked to near perfection.   Yes it is expensive, not a place to go every day, but you get what you pay for. It is worth the visit when in Copenhagen. And we could highly recommend it.   The good: Food:) Service (kind, attentive but not overdone)  The bad: Not much, but if I must write something than the price would be the downside  ","50"

"859simonh","Cosy personal restaurant. Asked on booking how we would like the experienced and we went for “relaxed” which was lovely.A very enjoyable 3 hours. We had the 6 course main tasting menu with paired wines - fantastic........my favourite was the beef and Jax .......the dessert. Service was very good, Katia did a great job. Each course carefully explained as was each wine.   Liked the open kitchen where you can watch the Chefs at work.  Nice surprise of the evening was a sparkling red dessert wine to match with last course, only 5% but went well, and a first for me. Other surprise - charged for water, this with the offered coffee and petit fours came to an additional £30.  Overall the main tasting menu and paired wines at 1200 each was good value and I would recommend.","50"

"kristenmY9795QP","I realize the reviews are glowing. But heed my warning - my husband and I went there for what we expected to be a glorious dinner while on vacation in Copenhagen. We expected the price tag and that is not the issue. Each course was more underwhelming than the next. Seasoning was nonexistent, the best “course” was the bread, which came have way through the meal (they “forgot” to bring it). The bland food was one thing, but the major issue were bugs. Fruit flies - upwards of 20 swirling around the small room where we were eating. First off - it was disgusting. Secondly, not what one expects when you are paying for a food experience at that level. The waiter even acknowledged the flies and made a joke. The only highlight was the wine pairing and do to our wine consumption, at some point in the evening we stopped trying to kill the fruit flies. All told - it was possibility the worst dinner experience I have had at a fine dining restaurant.","20"

"977pierrea","Maybe that’s what they call the new danish cuisine but it was really interesting by eating some products that I’ve never eaten this way before, plus the service was according to the price that you pay, but this not a 5 stars review due to the lack of communication about the portions, they do recommend the 4 courses but I recommend that they really should insist that it is almost the size of a soup spoon.  I hade a great evening","40"
"Christian_Gaertner","What makes an excellent restaurant for me? Excellent, ideally local/regional food and a friendly and attentive service. I do not need a posh location. And Marv & Ben is exactly this category of restaurants. Danish/Scandinavian food on a very high level (we had the six course menu with accompanying wines: excellent choice, good food-wine pairings, I especially liked the Danish potatoes with the mackerel and the sole) and very friendly service. Thank you, dear Marv & Ben team, for a very enjoyable evening!","50"
"Bhoom P","We visited Marv and Ben tonight and the meal was really good. We chose the 6 course meal and wine pairing. I can't really fault on anything. Ignore the review on food was small and feeling hungry afterward. I feel stuffed after the meal. OF COURSE if you are half a pig for dinner everyday, I might be hungry after. The meal and price is reasonable for Copenhagen.","50"
"anita3695","A memorable dining experience. Although expensive, totally worth the money. I have not tasted food like it and may never again. It is quite different and special. The staff really care about everything and looked after us well (not just a job to them). All the dishes were excellent. Take your time to enjoy it.","50"
"Lorraine V","My husband and I visited this establishment in August, 2018. It was an experience second to none. The food was amazing. The staff were knowledgeable and very helpful. We loved every minute. It is not inexpensive but truly worth every penny you pay.","50"
"Adamwaller89","We visited Marv and Ben on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu, with additional pre-dinner snacks and cheese. We did not want to drink an entire wine pairing and our wonderful waiter help to pick out two great wines.  The meals were perfectly sized and packed so much tasty punch that we were left smiling after each bite. The potato mackerel with cheese foam was a reminder of how great nordic cooking can be.   The price tag was very fair for the culinary experience that we given. We will come back to Marv and Ben again, every time we are in Copenhagen.","50"
"Tbills4","A set menu, but if you are willing to put your faith in the chef, you will discover some of the most creative, inventive food in Copenhagen. Each dish is a wonderful combination of tastes and textures, beautifully presented. This is creative cuisine of the highest order - I cannot say enough about how good this was. The wine pairing was excellent, and the entire evening one of the highlights of the trip to Copenhagen. Plan on spending roughly three hours to make your way through the courses, but an evening not to be forgotten. It is with good reason it is so highly rated!","50"
"jkojkl","My wife booked this restaurant as she was interested in trying one of Copenhagen’s edgy high-end places. I read the menu online before we went and became as petulant as an eight-year-old as I can’t stand precious foodie restaurants. I was so wrong. The food here was very very good. The execution was perfect and the flavors were interesting and delicious. And, even though it’s not cheap, I felt that it was great value (we had the full menu). The only comment I’d make is that they do push the pre-dinner champagne and appetizer course…which is not included. We declined and didn’t feel we’d missed anything.","50"
"Yvonne320","We wanted somewhere special to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and Marv & Ben certainly delivered. We embarked on this gastronomic experience with a glass of champagne and 3 'snacks', then both had the 'Almost everything' menu; one with the pairing wines. All 6 courses were an incredible mix of flavours, textures and inventiveness, though loyal to the best of Danish cuisine. The accompanying bread has also to be mentioned as it was probably among the best we have tasted. The portion sizes were perfectly judged (though appear small - deceptive) and we were certainly well satisfied at the end of the meal. Mention must also be made of the staff, who were all incredibly friendly, attentive but not intrusive, and passionate about the food. Everything combined it was a wonderful evening, so thank you Marv og Ben. We'll be back.","50"
"Evelicious","I walked in without reservation and was nicely accommodated by the friendly staff. Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there. Food was good and the service was very prompt and attentive. Truly a Scandinavian experience with a reasonable price tag.","40"
"KynetonSema","We recently ate at Marv & Ben’s and we’re blown away by the experience. The service was faultless and although we were served by a range of people they were fully cognizant of us. We enjoyed talking to them and learning more about the restaurant - all in their faultless English. One of us is a Coeliac and that was absolutely no problem and when the GF bread was served it was amazing. We chose the 400 kroner meal and our own wine selection and service in this area was attentive but not pushy. The water was also never neglected. The meal was four courses of incredible flavours - clean, fresh, modern Scandi! We did not leave hungry. Another lovely touch was the crockery but the silver ware was just stunning. All from a shop around the corner. We had a fabulous evening and wish we lived closer.","50"
"Donna S","We stumbled on this restaurant by accident, as we were visiting Copenhagen for the very first time, and we had no reservation. It was an absolute delight and each menu item on the 4 plate was absolutely delicious and totally awakened all our taste buds. This is a do not miss restaurant. Our server took great pleasure in describing each menu item, and I wish I could remember exactly what the items were made of at this time. Unfortunately, lapse in time in writing this review is unfortunate. It is the best restaurant we have ever dined.","50"
"Darcy Z","Michelin Bib Gourmand rated, but gets close to 1 star rating from me. The best meal of our trip to Copenhagen (we had dinner in 3 different Michelin rated restaurants), such creative and complex dishes, layers upon layers of flavours that work. Amazing that I can book a restaurant like this on the same morning using my iphone, and end up getting a private room for 8 with superb service. We had the 6 course tasting menu, plus a cheese course as well before dessert. We ordered a few beers to try and share, and they poured it into smaller glasses for each person at the table to try, what service! They even asked us what pace we'd like our dishes to be served at, which is the first time any multi-course serving restaurant ever asked us that. The bone marrow brushed bread was amazing, crispy crust and warm chewy centre. Our kids were starving for more and they offered to bring out extra loaves for us and they didn't even charge us for it! My favorite was the yakitori grilled lamb rump with grilled romaine lettuce brushed with fried spinach puree and dehyrated kale over green strawberries and fermented gooseberries. Such a simple looking dish, but so complex in flavours. Anyone who says the meat was too small or the lettuce was too simple in this dish, clearly didn't listen to what ingredients were used and didn't appreciate the amount of labour needed to create such a fantastic tasting dish. Beware they do use charcoal smoke liberally in some of their dishes (which I'm a huge fan of).","50"
"toxdoc42","This restaurant brings pretentious dining to its peak! The menu is a tasting menu ONLY. Don't even think of al la carte for the portion sizes are miniscule. Don't think about ordering wine by the bottle or glass, they want you to order the pairing and spank you financially if you don't.   I am an adventurous diner, I ordered the 4 course meal, the last was a ""dessert."" even with its small size, I could not eat the first course, a thin slice of cold halibut on something with some sort of source. When I failed to eat it, no one asked me if it was okay. The second course was some strange salad thingee which was also not at all something I could eat. The third was a charm, a delicious piece of lamb, done to perfection. But, it measured maybe 2 cm by 5 cm by 1 cm thick. It was accompanied by what was said to be grilled romaine on top of berries. The romaine was virtually uncuttable, and to find the berries I needed a magnifying glass. Dessert was some unnamed puffy stuff.  Not once did anyone ask if the dinner was okay. Not once did anyone even come over to discuss the dinner with us, and we were there for 2 1/2 hours!  We are used to NY City prices, but this place was off the charts. We are willing to pay top dollar for top dollar food, this is not the place to go to if that is your desire!","10"

"Dennis T","My wife and I had a great meal here in September. The Service was very pleasant and attentive. The food was very enjoyable. We ordered one 4 course and one 6 course meal, along with a bottle of wine. I always look over the complaints if I'm selecting restaurants with the help of TripAdvisor, and I will offer a couple of thoughts in response to the few people who have been critical. We found the staff to be very friendly and committed to creating an excellent experience. It surprised me that anyone had a complaint about service, but I suppose the risks of a problem are always higher for larger groups. My general reaction to Copenhagen was that the Danes are very friendly, relaxed, and welcoming to their tourists. We also found the pricing to be very fair (compared with the US, and especially considering that tipping is not required - and is never as big a cost as in the US). When I'm worried about pricing in a restaurant like this, the first thing I do is order an inexpensive bottle of wine and avoid the wine pairing (I trust restaurants like this one to offer only enjoyable wines). I hope many of you will try this place.","50"
"375kg","Marv&Ben has the best bread I have ever had in my life. This seems like a small thing but if you like good bread you know it is not. We had the four course tasting menu and started with the snack and champagne course. We also got the wine pairing with the tasting menu and the wines were outstanding and generously poured. The food is a great example of new Nordic cuisine and was both surprising and tasty. There are no gold dipped ants here, just good food and really friendly servers. The price was right too (much lower than we expected)for such a nice tasting menu plus wine.","50"
"Randy L","Drove into Copenhagen and stumbled upon Marv & Ben’s street level restaurant. What a find! We were greeted with warm smiles and a helpful staff. The food was unique in courses and presentation and very tasty. Would highly recommend you stop it for an enjoyable evening!","50"
"gosmart07","We dined here with another couple on Saturday, 18 August. Two of us selected the a la carte menu, two the six course meal. The food is inventive, with a plentitude of ingredients that you cannot remember or identify when they are reeled off by the waiter. However, the portions are TINY, and even thinking about ordering off of the a la carte' menu is a joke. The quantity of food was misrepresented by the waiter. On wine, we believed that we had ordered a bottle of wine to share, but they charged us by the glass, and then when we asked for glasses, brought an entire bottle. We had excellent new Nordic cuisine meals in Helsinki/Oslo/Bergen, but the owners of Marv & Ben need to re-think their model. Very disappointing! It astounds us that the resto gets so many ""5's""","30"
"Jeff S","The potato dish with the cheese foam had sublime texture contrasts. The food was inventive. The lamb was perfectly done,The hazelnut dessert was surprisingly good since I don't ordinarily like hazelnuts. The crisp marrow bread - to die for. Outstanding service including great descriptions of each course.","50"
"josephg493","it was a good evening and we enjoyed it very much. perhaps it’s not fair to other very good restaurants we’d been to if we rated this a little higher. the place is minimalistic, and slightly cramped, and windows needed to be opened for ventilation, just imagine if you sit near the windows when the night was cool. food was minimalistic, i would have rated excellent if i hadn’t tried things similar/better elsewhere. service was also good, but a little rushed and inattentive. he came, he told us what it was, he left. overall a good evening. the bread served stood above all.","30"
"ErikaT1796","My husband and I ate here during our recent trip to Copenhagen. I researched all of the options and found this place to not only be reasonable, but it also had great reviews. We had the 6 course tasting menu and couldn’t have been more delighted with the food. The fish was exquisitely prepared and the sauces were so tasty we wished we had bread to sop it up with. This was the first time I ever had raw beef; it was paired with a lovely, creamy danish cheese and melted in my mouth. We ended the evening with a very palate cleansing dessert made with lemon verbena and fresh herbs.","50"
"676kristianm","Enjoyed a nice dinner in perfect surroundings with a dedicated team. Marv & Ben is definitely one of my best dining experiences in Copenhagen combined with a high level of service. We had a great evening. Thank you.","50"
"LordSheepscombe","Marv and Ben entertained us with the perfect evening. The atmosphere was casual with a hint of formality, the service was exceptional without being in your face, the food was modern, interesting and of a very high standard indeed. The main course meat dish was the best piece of meat I have ever eaten in nearly 53 years on this planet and an awful lot of high end dining. We enjoyed the tasting wines and loved it that they were generous with their wine portions, (my biggest gripe with tasting wines). Our only disappointment as such was that we assumed Marv and Ben were people, maybe a couple or maybe Brothers and we would have loved to meet them afterwards to congratulate them. It turns out however, that Marv and Ben equates to Marrow and Bone in Danish, apparently we weren’t the first to get this wrong. They put the Marv and Ben to excellent use in the Bread and Butter, possibly the best bread and butter in the world. Highly recommended","50"
"bb2440","We started with the snacks - each very unique and quite good. The bread and butter is delicious. The restaurant has a very nice wine list and offers many by the glass options at 1/5 the bottle price. We ordered the 4 course menu and very much enjoyed each course.  The decor is quite nice and service is efficient and friendly.","50"
"StevenG3522","We dined here for dinner, being a couple in our mid fifties. Let me be upfront in saying that we have very little experience with Nordic cuisine, but have eaten in many fine dining/high end establishments throughout the world for many years. The resto is very well located, on a side street near many of Copenhagens central attractions. The decor is nice, with very welcoming and pasionate staff. We chose the 6 course taster menu with the wine pairings, along with the starter glasses of champagne and “snacks”. We are huge fans of “french style dining” (many small courses, with varied and intense flavours), and this looked like a Nordic take on same. The dishes were nicely plated, although no exceptional plating was provided. The wine pairings were the best part of the meal, with many excellent selections from France, Spain, Germany, California, etc...this was clearly the highlight for us.  Where we most felt let down was the food. While some dishes were good to excellent (lamb and beef tartar for example) some were fairly average and even a bit bland. My wife was overwhelmed with the amount of pickeling in the majority of the dishes (and snacks), ...so much so that it pretty much ruined the meal for her. For myself, I am not adverse to pickeling, but did find the usage overdone throughout the meal. I totally understand that the local cuisine may have an abundance of pickled products, but I have had many local and traditional fine dining experiences (Prague, Germany, Spain, etc...) were a healthy balance of local and international flavours was melded into a fantastic and distinctly local culinary experience. This was sadly not the case here. The price was somewhat high (about $500 US plus, with no extras beyond those identified above), and I cannot say I felt good value was provided for this price point. If you really enjoy many pickled dishes, you may have a better experience than we had, but as it stands for us....I cannot recommend this place based on our taste preferences and the resultant QPR. Too bad, as we were much looking forward to this meal!","30"
"Anders A","The location is great; nice staff and stylish interiour. But best of all - so tasty and elegant. We went for the big 6-course menu incl. the wine menu and with some starters first. Each course are pretty small but with 6 of them, bread etc. Then you will not leave the table being hungry. And on top of that - the restaurant is generous with the wine. All in all a very nice experience.","50"
"jennylcNg","The welcome was impressive. A good start. Cosy ambience and the kitchen and staffing levels looked really good. At least that was a good start. Great place for a special evening. It was an anniversary for us.  The presentation and explanations were really given very well. Nothing was too much trouble attitude really made a difference.  The snacks were unusual but if you have the set menu, you don't really don't need them. The tasting menu was really impressive with tasting wines added. Lots of alcohol.  Would go again. If a special occasion it will not dissapoint.","50"
"Deb S","Had a fantastic evening with 7 friends at this restaurant. I had never had New Nordic cuisine and the food was incredible. The presentation, the flavors and the portions were perfect. The bread was the best I have ever had. The owner was great fun and obviously very talented. I highly recommend this restaurant. If I ever get back to Copenhagen it will be my first stop!","50"
"Ann M","It s always great to enjoy Nordic cuisine. Only thing is standards have become very high in Copenhagen. The staff is definitely welcoming and efficient which is definitely a plus. Yet, I felt the food was very uneven. Some dishes were fab (the bread is actually to die for), yet others were trying a bit too hard to impress like the hazelnut chocolate desert that was far to sweet and which I could not finish. The spot is definitely worth a visit but I d say: guys don t try that hard and everything s going to be all right.","30"
"loulou_862","We had dinner at Marv & Ben on our first day in Copenhagen. The restaurant has a relaxed and casual ambience and is recommended by Michelin. The waiters were all friendly and helpful. They managed to find a table for us, though I would advise you book in advance. We just got lucky! We went for the set menu of 4 courses. The portions are tiny but I did feel full by the end of the meal. My friend was still a bit hungry. While I enjoyed all the dishes, I was only wowed by the dessert, which is why I give this restaurant a 4 instead of a 5.","40"
"Ihvash","Perhaps the kindest reception after we walked in late without a reservation, the team advised on the incredibly creative menu choices as well as wine list. Each dish is beautifully constructed, with interesting flavors accompanying classic products, like halibut, sole and lamb. The sourdough bread at the start and accompanying butter is simply to die for. Each member of the team is kind, humorous, explaining the make-up of the food and engaging on all kinds of other topics. A perfect introduction to our visit in Copenhagen.","50"
"Ade W","This is a very very good restaurant. I've eaten at a lot of great places in London, Paris and Rome but in terms of service, taste and sheer inventiveness, Marv & Ben ranks right up there. From the booking to the table, everything was super smooth and attentive without straying into fawning. The same was true of the service at table, neatly divided between five or six of the staff so that each course had someone different describing its flavours. We went for the four course set menu (we wished we'd gone for six just to experience more of the flavours) and opted for the wine selection which was superb. The fact that we are pescatarian was accommodated with open arms and there was no hint of compromise. We also went for the 3 x teasers to start... maybe a tad expensive but if you want big plates of food, try elsewhere... for sheer culinary inventiveness, come here. I won't describe every course but the potato dish (which sounds like it could be exceptionally dull) was just phenomenal in its depth and textures. The dessert was the best I've eaten anywhere - no exceptions. I will return to Copenhagen for many reasons but to eat at Marv & Ben again will be one of the foremost. Congratulations, guys, just wonderful!","50"
"RUbersax","Four of us had dinner at Marv & Ben based on high TA rating. Two of us had the 4 course tasting menu, and two ordered a la carte. Each of the courses were well-presented, and explained in detail by the waiter ...... and tasted super. For the a la carte orders, grilled lamb and lemon sole, the portion size was minuscule ...... more of a light appetizer than a full course meal. The volume of food was not commensurate with the high price. Although a direct comparison can not be made, it also appears that wine prices were on the high side. Total bill for 4 persons: 2000 DKK. Food 5*, minus 1* quantity, minus 1* price.","30"

"MisterAllen","I think I don't need to explain much, as it's quite obvious from all the previous reviews that this place is simply fantastic. With great and creative Nordic dishes paired with great drinks (I got nice beer!), fantastic services, and very enjoyable ambients, I would highly recommend everyone to come at least once in their lifetime.   The highlight of the service: I told them that I really enjoyed their homemade sourdough and wanted to bring back home, and the servers reached out to the kitchen and let me purchase two half-baked bread!! The bread was soooooo outstanding and is was like nothing I've ever tasted.","50"
"fransmunkr","I am actually more or less speechless, and there is no way I cant give this restaurant the maximum five stars!!! I never give the highest rating, but this experience cant get less.  The service is at top, the food is a great experience, very well combined with the selected wine menu. There was a very small glitch, where we were served the part of the wine menu before the dinner, but then what....the waiter quickly improvises and gets us another wine. A really good Barolo too which was perfect for the lamb. Top class!  All in all the best experience ever. A bit on the expensive side for a cheap guy like me, but I also maxed out on the tips. :) Definately worth it!","50"
"_xKeu_","Enjoyed a dinner of 6 courses plus additional snacks and cheese with wine pairing last week. The passion of the chef and service team is easy to spot, it reflects wonderfully in the fine tastes of the food and enthusiasm that is displayed by the team presenting it. The wine pairing includes unique wines from across the world and is a good addition. Absolutely delicious.","50"
"Ventana_SG","We had dinner and chose the 6 course meal. And we also ordered the light snacks. The halibut, turbot and sole were all done differently and tasted fresh and subtle flavours. The beef tartare was not as good as the one at Pastis which I happened to have for lunch. Perhaps its just their own style. Service is superb. The desert was sublime! All in we liked it all round and recommend it if you are prepared to spend. It was DK1700 for 2 including 2 glasses of wine.","40"
"fishes1","Very dissapointing dinner. We were told the snacks were 100 kroner including a glass of champagne but in reality it was half a glass and we were charged 200 each ! Once challenged the correct amount was corrected on the bill .Similarly we were charged 75 kroner for tap water !Again deducted once challenged . Overall the food was micro portion size, lacking in flavour and ridiculously over priced . We can't understand the the high rating on trip,advisor .Do you yourself a favour and go to Mielcke and Hurtigkarl instead it's infinitely better .","10"

"suep138","We made this the last meal on our Copenhagen trip. We had high expectations and were not disappointed! We started with champagne and the extra canapés which were fabulous. We then had the four course tasting menu and wine flight. Every dish was fantastic and the wine matched superbly! Yes, the bread was also amazing! We also ordered the cheese course which we shared. Neither of us had tasted anything like it. Cheese with a crunch, figs on top and a pear purée! Wow!! The service was great and this was one of the best meals we have ever had. We have eaten in 3 Michelin stars and lots of top restaurants in London. In the light of this , it was not hugely expensive! We highly highly recommend this place!","50"
"Monica M","It started when the four of us entered the restaurant and every single person from the wait staff to the kitchen staff greeted and welcomed us. I honestly thought we were celebrities! (and the others in our party commented on the greeting, as well.) What a lovely welcome!  The young girl who waited on us admitted that she wasn’t much of a wine connoisseur (better to be honest than to fake it!) and she sent over the sommelier. I had printed out the wine list and had even sent it to a friend of mine, who is a wine critic, to look at the menu and pick out some wines for us. When the sommelier saw that I had this list, he just said, “Tell me what kind of wine you like and I will find you a bottle.” He then proceeded to tear up my printed wine list, much to our delight!   Well…not only did his choice of whites go beyond surpassing the imagination, each one of us loved it. This is not a simple task as we all had different preferences for whites, from oak-y to not too sweet to fairly dry. We are far from wine connoisseurs and really despise wine snobs, but he was so fun, playful and knowledgeable that the wine selection became a game. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he didn’t try to sell us a ridiculously expensive wine, either. It was reasonably priced and paired lovely with our meals. Three of us were vegetarians and the other one didn’t eat the lamb, but he managed to fine both a white and a red that appealed to us. It is obvious that they place a great deal of emphasis on their wines and that they complement the meals incredibly well.  Now…on to the food…what a feast! For each of the 6 courses, there was a slight variation for either the vegetarians, no-lamb, no fish, no raw meat-eaters of the four of us, but NOTHING presented as a problem! The staff handled it all with grace and skill and our palates were thrilled! It was SO much food and we were so pleased that we had plenty of time to enjoy it. We never felt rushed and we appreciated being able to relax and enjoy each course without feeling like they needed the table.   Delicious food without the snobbery is such a novelty, but they master it with skill and grace","50"
"Anke S","We had dinner at Marv&Ben earlier this week and the restaurant exceeded our already high expectations. The staff was very friendly and professional. Most importantly, the food was incredible: fresh, original and simply delicious. The food-wine-paring was among the best we've had in years. The bill was perfectly adequate for the fantastic food and wine, certainly considering the price level in Kopenhagen. Overall, a dining experience that favourably compares with European restaurants that hold one or two Michelin stars.","50"

I was dining solo and received excellent treatment (not always the case when you are alone and the check will be smaller.) The bread and butter they bring at the start of the meal is possibly the best on the planet, now I will have to judge all other bread by this standard. I loved the wine pairings too. Wonderful overall experience, and the price is very reasonable compared to other restaurants of this caliber.","50"
"Lauren W","I can’t say enough wonderful things about my experience at Marv & Ben. They took us 30 mins early for our reservation without question to the best seat in the restaurant next to an open window, which felt amazing since it was quite a hot day. We got the 7 course I believe? With wine pairing and the snacks to start. Every dish was perfectly balanced, interesting and cooked to perfection. The wines they chose were spot on pairings. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and the speed of service was perfect (they kept it flowing but we never felt rushed or that they were bringing out dishes too quickly)","50"
"1johnkl1","Wow, food and service were wonderful, entertaining and exactly what we hoped for. We had the 4 course and was not disappointed at all, we also ask to change one course with another and Alex responded “ no problem”. The wines- 3 in a wonderful progression were perfectly matched. This is a must go restaurant.","50"
"ShropshireBlade","Wow! Fantastic from beginning to end. We had the 6 course menu for a party of 12. All dishes were superb. Staff were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable with great recommendations on the accompanying wine. Nice decor and atmosphere. A memorable experience.","50"
"Kieron V","Very high service standard. Super friendly staff. The food was presented perfectly and without fault. We had the full menu with wine. Perhaps it's a bit too much wine for the amount of food, but the wines were very well chosen and exciting to taste. I would definitely go here again and would highly recommend it.","50"
"ParisNewYork50","My husband and I just returned from a 3 week cruise/trip in Scandinavia where we experienced fine dining every night. As New York Manhattanites, we are spoiled with top restaurants at any given night. Therefore this is an affirmation to all the 5 star reviews given to this innovative restaurant. It is up there with the best. And as a footnote, we asked why the bread was the ABSOLUTE best bread we have ever tasted in our travels. The answer is that is is brushed with bone marrow (Marv & Ben is actually Danish for ""Marrow & Leg"").","50"
"terrysO2108SY","When we dined at Marv & Ben, they warned us the portions were small, seeing is believing. My wife had the Lemon Sole (see picture) and I had the Grilled Lamb (Picture) we had a starter and I had strawberries and she had the cheese plate for dessert (see Pictures). Before we ordered dessert, she asked if we could share the cheese plate, but they talked her out of it. The food is very good what there is of it. Prices are about the same as Krebsegaarden for equivalent items, but smaller portions.","40"
"eve1950","We happened to be walking down the street in the afternoon, when we saw a group of people enthusiastically discussing the service plan for that night. Looking up, we realized it was for Marv & Ben (for those who don’t speak Danish, it means “marrow & leg,” not the names of the chefs) and we were going there a couple of days later. We were welcomed as old friends when we arrived for dinner.  They have an a la carte menu as well as a tasting menu. The 4 course meal was just right, from appetizer to dessert, which in this case was this amazing, raspberry infused strawberry dish. When I indicated that lamb was not my favorite for the entree, the server suggested I still try it, and if I didn’t like it, he would bring me a different dish. I thought that was a gracious thing to do.   Wine by the glass is available from any wine on the wine list 1000 DK or less. The charge is 1/5 of the bottle cost, which was clearly noted on the menu.   Again, this is a trendy, creative restaurant which serves wonderful food. Definitely worthwhile.","50"

"JJ_EATS","This small locally sourced restaurant is a fine example of the new Copenhagen dining experience. They offer a number of excellent prix fixe dining options. The three of us, fresh off a long flight from NYC, chose the excellent “almost everything” option. Each dish was better than the previous, and well presented and explained by attentive wait staff. The wine pairings were excellent with representation from around the world. It’s an expensive restaurant, but worth every Krone.","50"
"tws1086","We arrived and were seated at a small table near the front door. Our server recommended the full tasting menu which we agreed upon. He then recommended we start with the snacks which we accepted but failed to ask the cost. We later found out they were $30/person for three one-bite tastes. They were good, but definitely not up to par with the rest of the meal for the cost. Our server then recommended we also order the wine pairing but when we politely declined, there was a very noticeable change in his demeanor which we felt inappropriate.  The rest of the food throughout the evening was wonderful-especially the lamb and the potato/mackerel dish.  Our issue was how the staff managed a very loud party which arrived just after us. They came in singing very loudly, banging their cutler together and ruining the experience for the entire first floor of the restaurant. We asked to be moved which they did. Then another couple arrived and five minutes later, also asked to be moved due to the ruckus caused by this party who thought they were in an English pub. Management should have asked the disruptive party to leave instead of ruining the experience for the rest of the restaurant. This party was completely drunk and likely spending freely which is probably why the restaurant allowed them to stay. We planned our visit months in advance, only to spend $400 and have our evening ruined due to poor management. Their young staff is highly skilled in the kitchen but needs further training on daily operations.","30"

"Canadianstraveling","We had a delightful dinner at Marv & Ben's during a visit to Copenhagen in mid-June 2018. We had reserved online and were warmly welcomed and seated at a very nice table near a window in the airy second floor dining room. We chose the six course (""Nearly Everything"") tasting menu with two glasses of champagne to start. Each course was beautifully presented and delicious, including the accompanying bread and butter! The food and ambiance were both great, but what made the evening special for us was the exceptional service provided by Rasmus (Erasmus to his mother). Marv & Ben is expensive but really worth the splurge.","50"

Absolute perfection ! Very innovative, perfect execution  The 4th course (lamb) was truly good, but .... after you've been shown with the first 3 courses what the chef can do, it seemed a bit less special somehow....  Dessert was a bit of a let down to be honest, but in most places, even the 3* places, this is the case - it is extremely rare to find a place where dessert is the one to remember  All in all - next time we are in Copenhagen, we will be definitely coming back and hoping to see this place getting a star in the near future","50"

"Helena Elisha K","I had the pleasure of eating dinner af Marv & Ben with my boyfriend yesterday, and it was beyond expectation. I had a pescetarian menu that just left me speechless after each bite, and a wine pairing that accentuated the flavours of each dish.  The waiters knew what they were doing and always had a smile on their face, which created a great atmosphere that only added to the unique charm of the place.  Most of their ingredients are organically and locally sourced, so it also gets 5 karma points from me ;-)  All in all an amazing gastronomical experience that I can only recommend!","50"

"RachelBerks","Granted we awere bumpkins! but for the staff to treat us as such led to a fleetingly unpleasant, but, also, hilarious situation, which we shared with everyone we've told.  Having been to the Fat Duck, we were quite expecting to be able to eat everything put in front of us. Only to find that, in one of their ""snacks"", the snack was a flake about 2 cm x 2 cm, served in a bowl about 20cm wide, actually filled with moss and soil and sand and stones. Some of our party swore they heard that we were told we could eat everything in the bowl. Which I proceeded to do... and nearly broke my fillings!  No profuse apologies or any apology at all. Which would have made us feel less stupid!  Following dishes were tiny! and, like another diner, we found unmemorable (certainly when compared with the starter ""snack""!)","10"

"SnorkelWales","From the moment we arrived everyone was extremely welcoming and seemed genuinely friendly. The restaurant was full so booking would be advisable. We decided to have the four favourites menu and were offered and accepted an addition of a glass of champagne and 3 small appetisers. The appetisers were nice, especially the cod roe but remember if you are coming from the UK everything in Copenhagen is relatively expensive and this added 400 dkk to the final bill. On the main menu we paired the four favourites with the wine flight. Every pairing worked very well. The portion sizes were an initial concern in that they seemed quite small but we both left feeling full but not ready to burst. The asparagus starter was light and fresh, it tasted like how freshly cut grass smells. Their sour dough is something else. The best bread I have ever eaten. The next course was a potato, mackerel and smoked cheese dish. We would go back just to eat that. The third course of lamb and asparagus was extremely good. The jus gave the lamb an almost game like taste. The fermented rubharb with yougurt dessert finished the meal off extremely well and the final “wine” pairing was a very well matched surprise. Great food, great team who really seem to enjoy their jobs. The next time we are in Copenhagen we will be back.","50"

"annamaris2017","I enjoyed dinner with myös friend at Marv & Ben. The service was vety friendly, prifessional and in a good way flirty until the last dishes wgen our original waiter appatently quit his working pass. After that we were left a bit alone with less attention, which lowered the ranking down to four stars.  The dishes were creative and all ingredients are local which is very ambitious. The dishes were delicious and fresh. We chose wine pairing, and some combinations actually exploded the taste sensors. However, in general the dishes were more remorable than the wines served with yhen. The fresh nyt not so sweet or creamy desert divided our opinions.  The major minus is based on that since main course the waiters barely paid any attention on us and the staff was a lot less attending as we left compared To wgen we arrived.  We had the 4 course menu with wine pairing.","40"

As a Coeliac I didn't find Denmark very aware of indicating gluten-free options, but here all the dishes in the menu were modified for me and I was able to have wonderful gluten-free sourdough bread to accompany my meal. The various staff who served us were incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and enthusiastic. They and those in the kitchen are to be complimented on the dining experience they have created.

The restaurant itself is in a little street at the city center, so it’s really easy to find. The ambiance of the restaurant was also perfect for the type of food they serve. We had the 6-course menu with wine pairing, it was amazing! The wine pairing was perfect and the food beyond delicious! The bread and the pork belly were a revelation! We also had three hors de oeuvre before the meal, like little appetizers, also really good. If you are going to have this menu be sure to come with an empty stomach it was a lot of food, although the portions were perfect sized.  We really enjoyed our evening there and if we ever visit copenhagen again we are definitely coming back!","50"

Johan, the owner, was super-helpful and service-minded over email over some logistical issues we were having in trying to meet up with a friend who was not going to eat, but maybe have a glass of wine with us (but didn't turn up in the end).

"jajalumaca","This place is actually worth a visit to Copenhagen. Any menu offers great food. Codfish & blue mussel or apple & asparagus = great & memorable food. Nice wine pairing. Attentative service. And the bread worth mentioning as well. They deserve the price they charge.","50"
"trippoilterribile","Very nice restaurant with friendly staff. The menu is really good with an eye on local products. I only have 2 suggestions: the first, we came to know tap water is drinkable in Denmark, I really do not like when water is served in different bottles if you are foreigner or local. Maybe is it because you made foreigners pay for water and not locals? It happens also in France, please avoid this. Second, especially on fish dishes be more generous with the fish, some courses where vegetable with fish ""as a side dish"". This two things would have gave you 5 instead of 4.","40"
"Kristina D","We had the upstairs to ourselves for a company dinner. The food was absolutely fantastic, the flavors of every dish was a sensation. The staff with Johan and Niklas took very good care of us and made the evening not only full of delicious food but also full of laughter. Thank you Johan for helping us plan an unforgettable evening. ! We will definitely come back!  /Kristina","50"

"vikki_lowson","We booked this in advance for my birthday as the reviews were so exceptional. We were prepared for the crazy expensive price but thought as it’s a special occasion it would be worth it! Unfortunately none of the courses were mind blowing. Everything was just nice. And for £300 we expected a lot more than just ‘nice’. None of the courses are that memorable and it was only a couple of weeks ago but I can barely remember any of them. I was also disappointed that they knew it was for my birthday but we didn’t get anything special, not even a mention of a happy birthday. The service was quite impersonal unlike other experiences we had in Copenhagen and it was the most expensive meal I’ve ever had in my life and honestly .. not worth the price unfortunately!","30"
"raspberry1982","We had a truly fantastic dinner at Marv & Ben on 26th January. We went for the tasting menu with matched wines and found the quality and innovation exemplary. The staff were also great and obviously passionate about the restaurant.... It was so good that the next night after dinner and a few drinks elsewhere in Copenhagen we went back to Marv & Ben for a glass of champagne and more of their excellent bread!! We look forward to visiting again when next in Copenhagen.","50"

"Sheree W","My first visit to Copenhagen and my first visit to this wonderful restaurant. .The food was incredible a wide variety of dishes with fantastic flavours that seduced my taste buds each mouthful was delicious, the presentation and attention to detail was fantastic. Even down to choosing the right wine Nicholas took time to make sure that everything was perfect. This little gem of a restaurant is one not to be missed.","50"
"WKGOKILL","From the start as we were greeted it was very classy and warm  Open kitchen and modern small seated areas ! Staff plentiful, informative of every dish and wine and perfect service for the type of restaurant.  Opened with champagne and snack all matches perfectly !  The the spectacular we entry for almost everything .  6 dishes all coming out with waiting team explains everything two personal highlights of this food heaven were the pork belly and the smoked langoustine but everything was near perfect and masterclass in food pairing with a danish theme!  The rye Bread and butter / heavens cream was so good almost addictive   Wine was paired but also perfect beer matching (which is needed)  ","50"
"Steinar V","I's not very often that I, as an amateur, get to eat twice at the same restaurant - within a week... This happened to me this year - by ""accident"", so to speak, as I had booked a table myself for an evening with my crew - and then received an invitation from someone else to dine at Marv & Ben a week before the dinner I'd planned. Anyway, it really helps in terms of assessing an establishment to visit twice. The first time, we were nine people and had a chambre semi-separé. The second time around, we were six and were seated in the main restauant. The service was noticeably more professional on the first evening than on the second, and it just felt like a different class restaurant. Not that it was awful or anything on my second visit, but our table just seemed to have to fight for attention, while we got it automatically on the first visit. As for the.food, we had the set six courses both evenings; the first time around with accompanying wine menu and the second time around ordring wines from the list. The food is creative and esthetically presented. However, as the price is quite moderate, it is also quite conspicuous that the produce to a great extent is basic and cheap. And yet, it tastes - on an overall note - between good and fantastic, and sometimes quite interestingly. Some dishes sound more fantastic when prsented than what they taste like - such as the potato dish with gherkins and lovage, which by the way was much more delicate on the first occasion than on the second. The tartar is not the best in town, however a little different. The absolutely best dish of them all was the first one - the cod with glass cabbage and a mussel foam. Sublime. A little sad, though, that none of the remaining five dishes reaches he same level... The wine list is limited, but with some very good wines at decent prices. All in all sympathetic indeed and close to, yet not entirely consistent enough to deserve the fifth star...","40"
"Eliza P","Kind and professional service, fantastic food, and beautiful servings - the bread and butter was specially memorable, but the dessert did not match up in quality to the rest of the courses.","50"
"almaferron8","We were 6 girls out on a Wednesday night. We had snacks and Champagne, 6 courses with wine paring. Everything was just amazing. Each dish had so much to offer and combined with the wines it was just a fantastic experience. All staff were so professional and nice, the chefs ran with most of the food and explained each element on the plate. We were in heaven for a night. I truly recommend everyone to go to restaurant Marv & Ben","50"
