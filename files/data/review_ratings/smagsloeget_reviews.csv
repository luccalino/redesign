"ggin92101","We were blessed to have this cozy little sandwich spot in our neighborhood, but it is worth going out of your way for. Like everyone else has said here, the sandwiches are ENORMOUS, and while my hungry friend and I were going to try two and split them in half, we could only get through one whole sandwich between the two of us. We got the roast pork which was fantastic, complete with crispy, salty skin. And even though we had limited time in CPH, we visited this restaurant a second time, it was that good (and had the pork again). In a city where everything is super expensive, this was a bargain, too.","50"
"the_one_dda","Small and friendly. The club sandwich was unusually large and good. No coffee((( but that is all I can complain about..","50"
"davidpM769RE","We were once and came back! Xxl sandwiches with many options. Fast, good food, vegetarian options.. perfect!","50"
"Trefton","Small little sandwich bar near Orstedparken. Excellent choice. Phenomenal quality and taste. Fantastic value. Just remember to ask for extra serviettes.","40"
"sarasmith152","Absolutely delicious! I had Bbq chicken with cheese. The bread was so good and a lot of chickens inside. I would definitely come back.","50"
"445sabinad","Even if it’s not located directly in the main square, it was absolutely amazing and tasteful! Sandwiches were so fantastic that we had to come back again (during our weekend trip) and try more variations. The fillings are made from high quality’s ingredients! One sandwich is also enough for two people, in case you’re not super hungry :))","50"
"RKJC8691","About a choice of 20 different Sandwich fillings! Massive size good to share! A must try for a quick lunch meal on the go when around the shops or bars!","50"
"sarahsZ3194IU","This is a fast food restaurant but wow is it good. The sandwiches are huge. We split a roast pork sandwich. My daughter had a vegetarian sandwich that she said was great. Our sandwich was delicious. I couldn’t identify all the ingredients though. The menu was not in English and they do not cater to tourist but we had no trouble ordering and felt comfortable. Prices were very reasonable. There is very limited seating.","50"
"810davyt","Found this place on a Google search for lunch close to our base. This was a short 8mins away so thought we'd give it a go. All sandwiches are one price (85dkk which is about £9.50) which keeps things simple. There is alot of choice...More","50"
"98hardeepn","I love sandwiches. So impressing me isn’t the most difficult thing in the world. But my wife is as picky as you’ll ever find somebody - and she absolutely loved this place! It’s a little run down and unassuming - but that’s part of the...More","50"
"issueskid","Upon arrival we found the place packed and not particularly appealing. We ordered a vegan and a vegetarian sandwich and were told there would be a 15 minute wait.   The sandwiches certainly look the part and they are hefty things too. They did not disappoint, I tried my wife’s vegan sandwich which has potatoes on it and it was excellent. Mine too was full of flavour.   Both of us were full after just half a sandwich so we asked for them to be wrapped to go. I have to say they aren’t quite as epic hours later as the bread starts to go a bit soggy.","50"
"Vossers","Delicious warm roast pork sandwich - enough for 2. Toasted rye bread and delicious combination of roast pork, crackling, pickled red cabbage and sliced gherkin. A great sandwich to have as a picnic you won’t need anything else all day!","50"
"Mange2teTA","My husband and I were there for lunch. I had the roast beef, he had the pork. Both were beyond delicious (and the men preparing the food were very nice and helpful---yes, there's a wait but I promise it will be worth it).   My husband, a 6'3"" male, was able to eat his whole sandwich. I, a much shorter female, was not. The kind gentleman wrapped my half sandwich and we were able to pack it to bring it back to our hotel where we have a tiny fridge. If I had didn't have a hotel fridge, I would have been heartbroken to leave such a gorgeous half sandwich uneaten.","50"
"simongb","Got one of these for takeaway. The choice is endless. The sandwich huge. Great flavor and really big enough for two people.","50"
"beargoh","I am not a sandwich person, but what they served won me over. On the first evening in Copenhagen, we had the Smagsloeget Recommend (#1 item in the menu) and on our last evening, the roast pork sandwich.   The Smagsloeget Recommend was to me a healthy sandwich, with lots of vegetables and some ham. The roast pork sandwich was like german style roast pork with pickles and sour cabbages. The roast pork was amazing. The skin were still crackling crispy even after 30minutes (we brought it back to our apartment to eat it with a bottle of ale).   A must eat when you are in Copenhagen.  ","50"
"peterj397","Really good sandwich. I paid 85 DKK for a sandwich. There are discounts for students and military servers though. I can recommend the place for a sandwich to go as the place is really small.","50"
"73aidam","The place is a small crowded sandwich shop. You might need to wait 20 minutes to get your sandwich and there no place to sit but it totally worth it. The sandwiches are delicious and the price is hones","50"
"hakon_adalsteins","I've been there many times and there is a reason why. Really good sandwiches with a large variety to choose from. I usually take my friends there when they are visiting.","50"
"dkrarup","I have to say, I am a Organic food lover, and Smagsløget sandwicheshave not yet found that path.. But what a firework of freshly made cuts, veggies, salads, piled in one sandwich.. let’s say: roast beef for instance.. it came directly from the owen steaming...More","50"

"koshersaltcayennepep","Walking through cosy streets, then being met with a counter filled with fresh bread, cheeses, hams and so on. This place makes your sandwiches fresh, a la minute. Definately the best sandwich tasted in the past 28 years... Will come back next visit to CH!","50"

"PeterWR28","We read about Smagsloeget in one of the local magazines so thought we'd give it a try. We ordered Tuna salad with all the trimmings plus a Serrano ham and mozzarella extravaganza. The sandwiches are freshly made so were told we'd have to wait 10 mins. Well it was definitely worth the wait.. we adjourned to a gorgeous vantage point next to the river and devoured two of the most delicious sandwiches we've ever tasted. Each one was big enough for two people of average appetite so you could save some money and buy one to share.... we were just greedy. In summary the perfect picnic food in a wonderful city.","50"
"ManMeetsFood","Fantastic little sandwich shop here with some massive sandwiches for a very reasonable price! All the meat is really fresh and tasty.  I got the chicken club as they were out of turkey. Real bacon in the sando and it was thick, mayo tasted like curry but was tasty and the bread was awesome. I don't generally like brown breads but this was excellent.   If you're staying at Copenhagen Downtown Hostel it's less than a 10 minute walk and the sandwiches are definitely worth it.","50"
"240ellier","Absolutely delicious. Probably the best sandwich I've ever had. 1 is big enough for 2 people. Around 75DK or 65 student discount. Definitely go here !","50"
"andykennett","So good I had to go back and get another one for the flight. The only negative is that there is that much choice you might get stuck!","50"

"IteratorFrank","Limited seating, but they do good take away packaging, so not to worry. Easy to navigate menu, with any good options. Unbeatable value. Excellent for a quick and delicious treat.","50"
"Yashpawar","My favorite sandwich spot in Copenhagen!! Reasonable price (student discount 55kr) and so many options!! It was actually difficult choosing a sandwich, but ended up having he smoked salmon with shellfish salad. The sandwich is large enough to split with a friend, unless you're super hungry. Definitely will be back multiple times.","40"
"Allison G","Very hearty delicious sandwiches that fill you up on your day exploring Copenhagen. Highly recommended! We can't wait to go back tomorrow for lunch.","50"
"Ulrike R","We discovered a lot of sandwich places in Copenhagen, but Smagsloeget was simply the best. The ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches are composed deliciously. There is a great variety to choose from. It is possible to eat there or to order to go.","50"
