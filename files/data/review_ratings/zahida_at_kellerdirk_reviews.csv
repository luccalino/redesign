"R3411FAadamr","I visited Zahida by myself whilst in Copenhagen for the first time, I have eaten Indian cuisine in many different countries and after seeing the top 10 TripA rating I had high expectations. The two things that stood out most to me were of course the delicious and authentic food but also the very welcoming and cool staff. My butter chicken main was top quality and I highly recommend it, the food was complimented by a friendly and funny staff who made me feel right at home. No surprise why they are rated so highly and if I return to the city there’s no question I would dine there again.","50"
"Go380426","My woman and I spent a romantic evening at this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the good service we received. We recommend booking a table in advance since the restaurant was completely full when we visited it. We recommended the vegetarian package deal. We absolutely loved it!","50"
"Rune V","I have eaten here 10+ times now and I am still not convinced whether the chicken burger or the excellent service takes the trophy! This is a must try if you visit Copenhagen.","50"
"ToddHinLA","This place was awesome. The decor could use some help but don’t be dissuaded, the food is great. We had the vegetarian pre-fixe and didn’t regret the choice. The buttery chick peas were amazing. Definitely would go back again.","50"
"tittaDK","I visited this restaurant yesterday with friends. None of us had been here before but we all wanted to try it.  As soon as we got in and told them we had a reservation, the waiter told us that someone had ""hijacked"" our table and we would have to wait to get a new one (which is quite weird since after you reserve they send you a message saying that you only have 2 hours to finish, because they are famous and so many people want to eat there). We finally got a table and we all chose the menus (2 chef's and 1 veggie). The appetizers were quite good, even though the Samosa was very very dry and clearly not made shortly before.  We then waited quite long, and after asking an older waiter about it he answer pretty rudly. Thankfully the food arrived short after and we got all the other 4 dishes together. Included with the dishes was some rice and similarly looking naan bread. I must say I neved had a worst bread than this one, it was cold and hard and had NO taste at all of garlic.   The lamb and tandori chicken were amazing though and I would definetly go back to have them again.   I would suggest people to visit this restaurant for sure, and hope to get the young waiter (which is amazingly nice) and good tasting naan bread. If that would have happened the dinner would have been 5 stars.","30"
"AyrtHogan","Excellent food with great spice combinations and full flavour. Attentive and kind service - one of the owners, Bobby, is a particularly vivacious character. Hard to come by Pakistani/Indian food and service this good in Copenhagen, let alone anywhere else.","50"
"jeppek2015","Tripadvisor ranks this as one of the best Indians in Copenhagen. The rest must be pretty terrible, because this one is not particularly good. The Butter Chicken didn’t really taste of butter, much more of ketchup. The mixed grill was reasonably okay, but had had too much. The naan bread was boring (factory made?). The female waiter was very nice, whereas the male owner was simply overdoing the familiarity.","20"
"Annemette P","I had the best night at Zahida and I must say, they have the best burger in Copenhagen <3 but we also had the chefs menu, so we could try a bit of everything, and it tasted delicious. The service was great and you really felt welcome. A warm and loving atmosphere! Definitely worth a try. I’m going back there soon.","50"
"Fie W","The butter chicken is amazing and I also got the chance to taste a bit of my friends plate, Mama's House Burger, which is booth spicy and very tasty. Waiters are sweet and create a nice informal environment. I went home with too much food in my stomach because I did not succeed to stop eating :D","50"
"Robinungermann","Very Nice Indeed... Cant forget this... Mama Mia! Tutti Frutti! Know what im saying!? Good Ol Nice dog","50"
"Ricky T","5 star from the food to the service, wad seated and looked after from a gentleman called bobby. Lamb chops were to die for and the atmosphere was just something else. Great job guys will definitely be seeing us again  P.s bobby my mrs loves you ha","50"
"adam22123","Firstly, the customer service was world class, really welcoming staff. secondly, their food tasted incredibly good. Big recommendation for this place.","50"
"imranfazal75","I would say service was great but food was not according to the expectations at all. Naan bread was old and not warm at all. Pakoras were also old n cold. Pilau was not pilau but Onion rice and was not warmed at all ( was old prepared). Only thing was good was beef kebab. Over all food was not good at all not worth to try again.","20"
"rajpareek","Warm, lovely hosts that liven up the eating experience; and surely the food is great! Though the menu is limited, the taste is authentic.","50"
"fetinb","Love this place. Amazing butter chicken and amazing lamb Chops. Service is charming decour is relaxing","50"
"ChristianFCPH","To me, Zahida is synonymous with love. Love to the food and to the people served. Perhaps the best chicken burger I Copenhagen, but also remember to try the more classic dishes - all served with love.","50"
"VB1917","The staff greeting us was very friendly and all, but the rest was just a mess. We waited quite a while for the first course (which tasted very good). Shortly afterwards we get one piece of naan and then nothing. Another waiter comes with some rice, but then they just leave us there. When the main course finally arrives the naan and rice is cold, and the new garlic naan is actually rather soggy and not good at all. The butter chicken is truly superb - great seasoning and the chicken is cooked to perfection, definetly some of the best indian food I’ve ever had. Their vegan rice/soup dish is mediocre at best.   The house wine was good, very good considering the price of 50 DKK.   Perhaps a night off, but all in all the food just can’t save Zahida from the poor service. Considering the price it is hard to call Zahida overrated, but it probably is.","30"
"Journey218632","Came there with my mom looking for some good Indian/Pakistani adventure and my oh my, we were in for a treat! We both went for the Chefs menu accompanied with some awesome organic Rioja wine.  Shout out to Bobby, my man! Thank you for a great dinner and drinks.","50"
"129richarde","Nice staff, relaxed atmosphere, we turned up at 6pm and it soon filled up while we were there. Very tasty...reminded me of UK","50"
"Sue W","This restaurant is quirky to say the least. Situated in the side aisle of an old cinema/club, with only candlelight, when you arrive it takes a while for your eyes to adjust to the low lighting. The menu is fairly limited but that is because everything is cooked fresh by one person. The recipes are those of the boys’ mother, who visits from England regularly to make sure the food is being correctly prepared. Great food, super friendly staff, interesting ambiance. Good value too.","50"
"Chilimalm","Amazing food, cozy place with a really good vibe and the best service we had for a long time! Gonna come back soon!","50"

"Wiktor S","Amazing Indian food and one of the best renditions of the classic butter chicken I've had the pleasure of eating. Excellent, personal and kind service, and cozy well designed interiors make for a great experience! Can definitely recommend if you need a place to eat good Indian food in good settings! 5/5!","50"

"jeanchristoph","Visited this place on a night out with friends and it was absolutely perfect! From the welcome we got when we arrived, the nice dishes that we could share and the general service and hospitality. Everything was perfect because the place apparently has a bar/club on Fridays and Saturdays so we could stay all night :)","50"
"sebde","I dont know how anyone Can say anything bad about mammas boys. Amazing service, amazing food and amazing vibes in the restaurant! Please Continue this standard and you Will go far! See you soon","50"
"565theiss","Funky place at the old ""kellerdirk"" that works as a foyer bar for the Aveny T Theater.. so it ill get crowded with people having drinks every night before showtime. But the restaurant has left a cozy area for a la carte dining and is offering both a la carte and fixed menus.. also GOOD vegetaian options. Traditional Cuisine in a local setting, covered with tiny modern details makes it a great Copenhagen/Asian Experience. We will be back.","50"
"jeetees94","Just came out of Zahida restaurant with my friend and felt like putting a review right away.  First of all the service was very warm and friendly, one of the founder was very energetic and kind, putting people in excellent mood.  He advices us to take the menu but it was for two, and as we’re not both vegetarian we took a la carte. Sharing the starters and having a main course each. (I couldn’t resist the cheese cake at the end).  It was delicious, tasty, perfectly spicy and good quantity! You can always order more rice or naan, which is perfect.  The space is well decorated, stylish but not too pretentious at all. Great location !   Thank you again for such a good time !","50"
"touristTiia","We saw the reviews of the restaurant, and even though we didn't have a reservation on Saturday evening, we wanted to give a try. Fortunately we were lucky to get seats. The waiter was the best one I have ever seen, he was extremely friendly and kind. The food was delicious and the restaurant/bar was very cosy. I will definitely go there back if I will have a chance, but then I will make a reservation so I know that I'll get a seat :)","50"
"nilesh_nagar","Finally I got something vegetarian in Copenhagen. It was great and taste was yummy. Felt like at home in Copenhagen. They have plenty of options specially for sub continental food lovers. All the best for the future.","50"
"ShayneA39","The Amazing Affridi Brothers did it again. I have followed them since the beginning. They have made a lot improvements since last I tried their food. Impeccable service as always from Bobby and stunning food from Shane and the team in kitchen.   We were treated like royalties and they surprised my sister with a birthday mango cheesecake.   Can't wait to come back again.   Much love, Shayne with a why","50"
"Worldtravler360","Went here with some friends after being told that its a must try! A hidden gem in Frederiksberg. Wow must I say. Mest food I've had for a long time and the service was unbeliveable. This is a must try if you like food that has been made with passion","50"
"713niamhg","Came here due to all the incredible reviews and we were not disappointed! One of the most friendliest restaurant we’ve ever been in. The front of house was so welcoming, and chatty, and really made us enjoy our visit. He recommended some dishes, which we had and they were fabulous. The food is authentic Pakistani/Indian food.   As well as that we had some gorgeous cocktails. The place was very busy for a Tuesday night which shows how good the restaurant is. Only which I lived in Copenhagen so I could come here regularly. Would definitely recommend this restaurant if you’re in the area","50"
"gersbycruising","I definitely recommend to try out Zahida, had my birthday dinner with family there. Very friendly staff! Such a lovely evening in a “hyggelig” atmosphere, and the food was on point. But be careful, you will be coming back for another visit!😉","50"
"kate_11x","Amazing food. We all ordered the butter chicken, along with a samosa to start. The yogurt sauce that comes with the Samosa is very tasty. Butter chicken is delicious - right amount of spice for me (though if you like really spicy, tell them). Rice that comes with the chicken is also great. Service is FANTASTIC! Friendly, funny, efficient, and attentive. The history behind this place is that it’s named after the two brothers’ mother. Great mood lighting and atmosphere. Would highly recommend!!","50"
"MundaLahori","still the best, still number one. love the mamas boys and the magic they create. frequent visitor. gets better and better","50"
"Sandrine R","We had a dinner there. The menu was so delicious. The place is lovely. My husband and I agreed that it was the best pakistani food we had ever. The food is served by one of the brothers/owners. He was so kind, very passionate and also very cute . We just now wish that they open a new restaurant in France, in Montpellier .","50"
"T4818INandrewg","Cozy atmosphere lit mainly by candles. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff were friendly and attentive. Hospitality like this is in short supply nowadays, five stars don't even cut it. The masala marinated lamb chops and the tandoori chicken were seasoned and cooked to perfection. Although I'm nowhere near being vegetarian, their meat-free dishes truly deserve praise as well. The butter channa(chickpea alternative to their butter chicken) is just incredible, and the palak aloo(vegan spinach and potato curry) probably takes the prize as my absolute favorite.  Rock on lads, I will definitely be back!","50"
"Cdps","Met Bobby and his team on an imprint visit for food, the place was heaving but they fitted us in and serves us some fantastic food... A gastronomic masterpiece of Asian family food based on Bobby's mum's recipies... A small menus but everything done perfectly and the chicken is to die for... As is the lamb and the... Well everything really.","50"
"petermichelsen","Whenever I have people going to Copenhagen, I always tell them that the one place to check out is Zahida. It's amazing Pakistani cuisine made by some of the friendliest people you're likely to find anywhere in the city. I've just been round for a ""quality check"" and it's as good as it ever was. Do not miss out!","50"
"Gustav J","We had a great night! Everyone was accommodated. The vibe was laid back with great and relaxing music and a delicious smell of authentic Pakistani food. The food itself definitely lived up to it’s promise and had a amazing and authenic taste with just the right amount of spices. The waiters were nice, funny and provides a great experience. Definitely worth the visit - especially as a larger group. I am however going to visit on my own the next time I feel like having the best Pakistani food in Copenhagen.","50"
"HJMilner2014","Visited this restaurant last night and it did not disappoint. The service was exceptional - really friendly and personal with loads of suggestions about what to order.

"PetraA737","Great Pakistani food with rich flavours. Each dish has its own distinct character and you just have to finish them all.

"859simonh","First ignore location on tripadvisor, its the previous one. Address is correct put it into google maps - job done. Unique building - its a theatre on one side and after ten the tables are cleared to become a club! The place was buzzing with pre christmas parties and the service was excellent. Bobby the co-owner was really present, giving good service and tips on places to visit during our stay. Food really good, like the simplicity of the menu. Food authentic, pakkoras were the best I have had. The tandoori chicken was lovely. Jax had the fusion chicken burger, crossing the asian -west food divide, it was outstanding. All reasonally priced. Nice selection of beers all at 65 each. Would reccommend.","50"
"ArjSood","If you are in Copenhagen and want to try Indian food, I recommend that you visit Zahida for a flavourful and delicious indian and Mughalai food!! I ordered the Butter Chicken Currey, Lamb Chops and Dal soup. All three dishes were very well prepared with the best of spices and flavours.   It was a bliss having hot Indian food in freezing temperatures.","50"
"tinat614","Amazing restaurant! Easily the best butter chicken and crispy chicken burger I’ve ever eaten. The pakora also deserves a mention. The service is fast and friendly. Bobby and his brother have created a fun eating experience with delicious food. Highly recommend.","50"
"ChrW","I visited the restaurant with a friend from Pakistan. He rated the food quality very high. The waiter Bobby and his brother in the kitchen are very friendly, so we enjoyed the evening. The beers are handcrafted selections- great , but the wine list is very limited - only the house wine by the glass. It was rated very favorable by my friend though.  We had the chef’s menu. I was especially looking forward to the lamb, so big was the surprise that the kitchen had run out of lamb! We dined at 19.00, and the restaurant was only half full!! We got some vegetarian dishes instead, which tasted great but not the same... I was expecting some discount, or something on the house, but they even charged for an extra order or chicken.. The table for two is too small, the seating too tight, so 5 circles would be far too much. 4 if the lamb had been there, now they end at 3 even though the food is worth going for.","30"
"733jamieo","Owned by two bothers using Mammas recipes. Had no idea this place existed. It was just simply beautiful. I had the butter chicken. Just to die for. The service was exceptional. The boys made it a fun night. Overall food and experience is exceptional. Highly recommend!!","50"
"999cecilieb","I’ve been to Zahia a couple of times now and each time it is such a great experience. Last time I went with some coworkers - we ordered the “chefs menu” and got a lot of delicious food to share.  It was a bit to spicy for some of them but they were so sweet and made some of the chicken less spicy for them. But what I like most about Zahida are the 2 brothers who owns and runs it. They truly knows what personal service is and how to make every costumers feel special.  ","50"

The Food and service was excellent, and the waiter who severed us went out of his way to recommend what we should try on our fist visit. Already thinking about going back tomorrow, for all the dishes we did not try on the menu.","50"
"Brian a","This has to be the best restaurant in the City, English hospitality and good quality food very well presented. I'm not sure why There are 1 star reviews but maybe from inexperienced individuals with little experience of eating out. But they are well of the mark. I ate here 3 times in 1 week nothing to complain about. As a frequent traveller to the Nordics Zahida was a great find!! The food was outstanding both from a presentation point but also taste and quality. It was something very different. The hospitality in Copenhagen I always find a little abrupt and harsh but not here. The two brothers running the show are English and just have that English style of engagement that is great.I would eat here again and recommend a visit.","50"

"Tourist66533634235","I was lucky enough to be invited, for the opening party at Kellerdirk. Not only did they serve amazing welcoming drinks, the hosts were socialising and had time for each guest attending. Me and my family didn’t see that much to Shane, but we got an impression of him through the amazing food, which I hadn’t paid anything for. I got a taste of some of the different choices on the menu, and I must say hands down, that Shane has provided best experience with Pakistani food that I have had. It’s a restaurant ran by caring brothers, who are doing everything in their power to ensure an amazing evening for each of the persons visiting. Can’t wait to come and eat there again!","50"

"spaceboy2000","Can’t understand all the positive ratings on tripadvisor, and - the photos are from another restaurant.   Took the veggie set menu. Great presentation of the food, but unfortunately totally underwhelming taste.  Dry and over cooked starter - samosa Lentil soup taste was ok - but lentils were hard and chewy.  Chana Masala - worst I ever tasted. Tasted like a tin of chopped tomatoes with chickpeas in. Rice was way way way over cooked, cold and clumpy. I didn’t even know it was possible to over cook rice.  Soggy naan bread - I mean, did the chef drop it in the dishwater on the way out of the kitchen?  Dirty cutlery, had to change it twice.   Very dark in restaurant. Just as well.   Saw in the kitchen on the way out. Wow. If I had seen in there on the way in, I wouldn’t have eaten here at all.   Great cocktails, but they are from the bar next door.   My recommendation, avoid.","10"
"bossbb","Can’t understand all the good reviews on tripadvisor. Place is loud, unclean and food is NOT good. But the worst thing is the state of the kitchen. If you go (which you should not!) take a peek into the kitchen when paying the bill. It’s so messy and dirty!","10"
"nikolaj03","I took my employees out for a meal. We got both a service and a food experience that I haven’t had in a very long time. The environment was vibrant, staff so friendly and the food so authentic that you could taste the love and good fresh ingredients. The service manager Bobby came to our table and told us about there story, and how they learned to cook from a young age with there mother back in Pakistan. Bobby was present through the meal like every good host should be. We were very excited when the head chef Shane came to our table asking how we liked the food. That’s something that you would only expect from a Michelin star restaurant or at least a very expensive restaurant. After the meal Bobby walked us all to the door and thanked us for the visit.  This place is definitely one of the best experiences I’ve had in Copenhagen.","50"

"elisimmons","With confidence, I can say that my experience at Zahida was easily the best experience I have had at a restaurant in my life. From the food, to the ambience, to the excellent service, every element of the experience was impressive and memorable.   The Service: A couple of weeks ago, I visited this restaurant with my father, and a couple of days ago I came back with a friend of mine. During my first visit to Zahida, Bobby, the co-owner of the restaurant, asked for our names and then remembered our names throughout the night. He was incredibly personable, kind, warm, and engaging, expressing passion for his profession as well as a rare attentiveness to each of his customers. Bobby single-handedly busses every table in the restaurant and engages with every customer with the same level of intensity and enthusiasm. Upon my second visit to Zahida, Bobby remembered my previous visit and even remembered personal details my father and I had shared with him. This time, he was just as personable and enthusiastic as the last, sitting down at an adjacent table at one point during the night for a few moments to share a little bit of the story of Zahida with my friend and me. Bobby made us feel at home and expressed a kind of hospitality I have not frequently experienced, either at a restaurant or elsewhere.   The Food: The food at Zahida is, quite simply, delicious. Bobby co-owns Zahida with his brother, Shane, who is an absolute master in the kitchen. During both of my visits, I took Bobby's requests and was profoundly impressed both times. Everything from the samosas to the rice to the chana masala to the chicken is cooked and spiced to absolute perfection. (My mouth is watering just thinking about it!) It is the best Pakistani food I have ever had, and easily the best and most memorable meal I have had the pleasure of eating at a restaurant.   The Ambience: Zahida is tucked quietly away in a nice spot near the Frederiksberg palace and gardens. I visited for dinner both times, and so had the pleasure of sitting in a cozy, candle-lit space, surrounded by the murmur of friendly conversation. Zahida is a truly hyggeligt and homey environment.   Note lastly that the prices at Zahida are by no means outlandish, especially considering the quality of the food and the service.   Bobby and Shane: Keep up your incredible work. You've got something truly remarkable going here and have given me a meal and an experience that I will not soon forget. Visiting your restaurant has been one of the highlights of my few months living in Copenhagen for an exchange program, and I will most definitely be back before I leave. I wish you guys all the best.  Zahida: Bobby told me you would read this review, so I just wanted to say hello and affirm that your sons are remarkably talented individuals. I give you all the credit!","50"
"Michael S","Come in and feel welcome with hugs and love. A little chic but overall nice decor. The coolest karma from the owner and the best Pakistani / Indian food I have ever eaten :-) I chose Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken with naan The best regards to the two brothers and the rest of the staff and many thanks for a superb experience and total delicious food I'll be back","50"

"catalinar319","We found the place after going around a couple of times as at the entrance it only says Kellerdirk on a green parasol so we were unsure of it is the place. It is a cosy place, the guy greeting you is lovely too. We ordered the zahida's curry which was nice, not too spicy, very tasty, maybe a bit oily. The fries were nice and crispy. The home burger was surprisingly a thick chicken burger with salami slices on top - still tasted nice. The masala chips were fairly spicy but very nice. The garlic naan bread was more a plain bread as didn't taste of garlic at all. For all this and 2 beers we paid about 600 krone.","40"
"Bhalothia","I was visiting Copenhagen with some Indian, German and French friends and we ended up going to Zahida for Dinner (Thanks to TripAdvisor). We didn’t plan this so we had no expectations from the place and that added on to the surprise.. I think I can easily say that it was the best Indian/Pakistani ( its the same) food I have ever eaten in my life outside of India.   On top of that, Bobby is the smoothest talker you would come across. He engages with you from the first moment and guides you throughout this beautiful food journey. Although I’ve only eaten just once at this place but I can’t stop talking about it.   Bobby, keep it up!","50"
"Mara L","I can proudly admit that I have never eaten food that was more delicious than at Zahida's. My husband and I went here for our first dinner in Copenhagen and boy that just raised the bar for all other restaurants! The interior and location are quite unique (right next to a little theater) and the service is attentive and incredibly personal. I have called ahead to make a reservation and Bobby, who is one of the owners, remembered my husband and my name the whole time. He gave great recommendations on what to order (I love the fact that they have a small menu) and even gave recommendations on where to go afterwards. The place filled quickly, so go ahead and make a reservation, but definitely go and check it out!! You will not regret it ;)","50"

"AidanK94","We had a very memorable lunch today at Zahida's. It definitely lives up to its great reputation. We had the curry and grilled chicken with some naan bread and rice, which were just incredibly tasty - all based on recipes from home-cooking. It was very good value for money for Copenhagen as well.  The service - ran by the two brothers who own the restaurant - was very personalised. They were delightful and fun to speak to. This gave the place a very homely feeling.   I would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoys Indian/Pakistani food, or to those who like good food in general to be honest. The level of spice - which was tailored to us - should be very manageable for most people as well.  We wish the guys success with the new restaurant. Based on our experience today, I'm sure it'll do fantastically. 5/5 well deserved.","50"

"Peees","We ordered “Zahida’s Curry” mainly based on others recommendations which gave us high expectations. Can be a bit wrong to do as you only will accept the best. We got the food, together with rice, with a beer. Wonderful smell that really tickled your senses to eat. The somewhat mild level of spicy fit perfect. If you like it mite hit that’s of course easy for the kitchen to fix. However, the dinner did not match our expectation, it passed it with a wide margin. Extremely good!   Unfortunately we were there a bit late, they close at 21.00, which didn’t allow me to order another plate.... If you care about money this is a bargain! About 100 Danish krona for a dinner you will enjoy a lot and remember a long time. Visit! /Eric","50"

The food at Zahida reminded me of some of the food they make. Certainly not the best Pakistani food I have had but if you factor in the service, Bobby’s attentiveness and price it deserves 5 stars. We tried the chefs menu which let us try the most common things on the menu.","50"

When writing this review, the restaurant is no 1 on TripAdvisor and after testing it I would say they should be happy if they made it to top 100 at all.","20"

The selection is simple with a perfect combination - something for every craving. The burger is amazing. Perfect for a Sunday fast food day. The lamp chops delicious and I’m normally not a fan of lamb - but Zahida is the master of this - really. I love their curry - simple with a spicy taste and the crunchy green pepper chunks really compliments the dish. The chicken is so tender - don’t think I have had it better elsewhere.  And remember to try the mango lassi - it’s sweet and creamy - perfect as a “dessert” for afterwards. Yes I’m a really big fan of Zahida’s food and last but for sure not least I’m an even bigger fan of the food wizard Bobby. Service, standard, engagement, interest for his guests’ well being and his food perfectionism - I have never experienced anything like this.  My absolute greatest recommendations goes out to Zahida and Bobby.","50"

"X6962SImargareth","Myself and my husband had seen that this restaurant was top restaurant in Copenhagen. We travelled by taxi 15 mins from the centre so that we could eat here. I was so dissapointed to see that this was a stall in what could described as a food hall. We shared a main course as all staters were gone. Very little choice. Im not saying the food wasn't nice but don't understand how it us rated over some of the other fantastic and ambient restaurants elsewhere in Copenhagen.","30"

"travelmum415","Mama Zahida, if you are reading this, you should be very proud! Bobby knows how to run a great little spot in Copenhagen and I hope the plans to expand include the US one day.   I ventured to the food market just to see what all the fuss was about on TA. Bobby was behind the counter, welcomed me warmly as a solo diner, and led me through a memorable and delicious culinary experience.   The daal was outstanding, the chicken curry delicious, the naan pillowy and warm, the beer crisp and cold, but the true standout was the grilled lamb. I wouldn't have chosen this if it wasn't for Bobby's advice and I sure am glad I listened.   The lamb is marinated in a spice mixture like no other and then grilled to tender perfection. Bobby will give you a glove so you can pick off every morsel that a fork and knife may miss. It's served on a bed of fresh baby spinach --- be sure to eat all of that, too, as it becomes tossed in the leftover spicy lamb marinate and a soothing yogurt sauce.   It's not just the food that's great, it's also the vibe that Bobby creates with his customers. He talks with, and joins up, many diverse customers sitting round, sipping the fine beer, and awaiting the tasty food. There were people from Sweden, Italy, India, and the US the Saturday night I was there and he made all of us feel like old friends over his fine meal.   The menu is tightly focused on a few curries and a few grilled items. Zahida's is executing these choices extremely well. If you desire a 10-page menu, you may not like being constrained. That said, I would rather have fewer choices that taste this good than lots of choices that may only be mediocre at best. Bobby's choices are full of flavor, bring both the spice and the taste, and the whole experience made me understand exactly why TA rated this spot as the best in all of Copenhagen.   Make the trip to be food hall, cozy up to the counter, look Bobby in the eye, and say just three words: ""Feed me, please.""  ","50"

"oneworldtravelbug","My fiancé and I dined at Souls, Olive Kitchen, Kød, the Red Box, Krebsegaarden, Kødbyens Fiskebar, Cafe Gl.Torv, Le Sommelier, and Zahida while I stayed in Copenhagen for one week. Zahida is squashed in the middle of a mall and you eat at the counter. Not a place for sit down service and definitely not mid-range. Should be put in low end eats. The food was fine, flavorful and relatively quickly served. You got to watch them cook your meal while you wait.","30"

"MelBroderick","Zahida is a little gem! Pakastini food bursting with flavour.  The group I was with all ordered curries. I wanted a surprise and Bobby delivered just that. I got a Lentil Soup topped with raw chilli, ginger and coriander and I mopped it up with a tasty garlic naan and was even given a golden spoon to eat it with. The service was fantastic, Bobby’s Mama should be proud. He went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed it, it wasn’t just a meal it was an experience.","50"
"Ninaklepacki","If you like me love a good meal Zahida is definitely the place to go - you are guaranteed the best quality and service every time. Owned by the coolest brothers in town Bobby and Shane, putting a personal touch to the food and making it more than just another restaurant. So if you find yourself close to the cosy Westmarket or just in Denmark somewhere you should not hesitate to drop by Zahida and get a meal of a lifetime!","50"
"Chrismayn","I'm hoping to convince you to try the unique combination that Zahida, a Pakistani food counter brings to the Westmarket in Copenhagen, Denmark. ...I believe it's almost worth getting on a plane for!  I was first attracted to this new food business during a weeklong trip to the Danish capital this past June. A Carolinian colleague and I shared a bowl of curry and a beer that proved the diversity available in cosmopolitan Copenhagen and brought with the experience enduring memories of authentic spicy flavours.  The place had opened recently, but the TripAdvisor faithful had pushed it to the very top of the city's overall restaurant rankings: number one out of more than two-thousand entries... Not bad for a contender with only six bar stools and no tables of its own!  A Little Bit of a Man Crush The food is definitely the star of the Zahida show, but Bobby Affridi is definitely the best MC there is; he's like Steve Martin introducing U2 at the Hollywood Bowl, where the concession stand is serving the best, most tender curried chicken that you've ever tasted. And, as with most of the greatest food that I have tasted around the world, there is a great story that goes with it and it features strongly in Bobby's promotion of the Zahida brand.  Eating alone is not a problem; Bobby will provide more than enough personality to make you feel welcome and you can be assured that the world will be coming to eat with you soon enough.  'Mom' is the Key OR It's all in the Family In fact, ""the Zahida brand"" does the business (and more importantly, the name) a disservice, for it's the name of the one person who has inspired this business more than any other: Bobby's mother. Hailed on company's website as: ""the soul and heart, the tradition bearers and innovators of Pakistani food culture"", 'Pakistani moms', and Bobby's in particular, has brought this subtle, rich, spicy, savoury and innovative cuisine to life for a new generation.  Mother Zahida left Jhelum, a city of more than 140,000 in the Punjab province of Pakistan, 120 kilometres southeast of the capital Islamabad, in the mid-Seventies. Weighed down by only her ""optimism, love for authentic home cooking and a bag of home ground spices"", she settled in Manchester in the UK. Not quite the multicultural and vibrant commercial and media centre that it is now, Bobby says ""the 70s weren’t the easiest times to acquire all the comforts from home,"" but, somehow, she managed to keep the faith and raise five children, each one a passionate champion of her authentic, home-cooked fare.  The familial links to each one of the dishes make Zahida's menu all the more special and the passion expressed by Bobby as he takes your order and proceeds to treat you like a royal relative or long lost friend is invigorating after a long day sightseeing or working.  The menu also takes pride of place in the design of the food stand. Its bold, contemporary and friendly sans font is like chalk on a classroom blackboard. It sits in the centre of the booth between the counter (front of house) and the kitchen, but it's barely 20 square metres of space. The cosiness of the premises echoes the closeness of the family ties that form the foundation of the business and sit well inside the open, casual and eclectic food the Westmarket serves and the clientele that food and that atmosphere attract.  The Main Event The very best food of the sub-continent is always a mix of the finest spices and freshest ingredients, expertly combined and (usually) applied to chicken, lamb or goat for extended marination. At Zahida, tenderness is assured by careful preparation and a meat thermometer that makes sure that the meat is just cooked and not at all dried out. This technical approach greatly enhances the authentically traditional, family honed flavours and is more commonly found at the fine dining restaurants that come second, sixth and ninth in the TripAdvisor top ten of Copenhagen.  The simplicity of the meat is then complemented by a hearty vegan Tarka Daal, steamed rice or a plain or garlic Naan bread and topped with spinach and cilantro. You can pick and mix from these accompaniments or just go for the full house.  My friend Paz, the son of a Bradford-Bangladeshi restaurateur, demands that you hand back your cutlery as soon as you sit in any curry house, and this is how Zahida's menu is best enjoyed. Your mouth is simply doing too much, as it tries to convey to your brain all the flavours present, to worry too much about the texture; this is where your fingers compliment your experience. The freshness of the ingredients and the multitude of textures encourage you to grab that next mouthful until your plate is clear.  Beverages for the Occasion Zahida does the best job of representing Pakistani food, with a British twist, in a great European capital. At this stage, if you've read this far, you might be wondering what Denmark brings to the party and why you should visit Zahida for a curry over one of the many Scandinavian and European restaurants around the city. How about the beer? A lot of curry cultures around the world know that the spicy fare of the sub-continent is at its best when accompanied by an ice-cold lager or pale ale; it's lucky that Bobby has commissioned one of each of his own.  Brewed nearby, to recipes specially devised for the Zahida menu, their fresh flavours excellently complement the rich and spicy food and are much more nuanced than the bland offerings of the international brewing giants.  If you're not partaking in alcohol at the moment there's also authentic Mango Lassi or sodas from the usual suspects.  Bobby and his brothers in arms are ready to welcome you for lunch or dinner, seven days a week, Monday to Saturday 1200 - 2100hrs and 1200 - 1700hrs on Sundays. All nationalities of the world are warmly welcomed like an old friend and Bobbi may be able to greet you and even parle in your own language!  Anyone can love Zahida as much as I do. All you need to do is make that first trip and you will want to return time and again.","50"
"Mose72","Bobby and his brother run a top restaurant in the heart of Copenhagen.  First time there and I had the full bhuna. Started with the mixed grill, lamb chop and chicken it was fantastic.  Next up was the chicken curry, rice and garlic naan. I asked for the ""Danish"" hot it wasn't particularly spicy, but it was certainly tasty. All of it was washed down with some pale ale, lovely.....   Looking forward to becoming a regular.   Thanks Zahida.  ","50"

We were serve by Bobby. One of the most charismatic people you can find. We asked him for advise and each one of us ordered something different. Everything was amazing. After dinner, we spent hours discussing which dish was the best. We couldn't get to an agreement, all of them were unbelievable tasty. Personally, I can not wait to have that chicken curry again.  100% Recommended.  Thanks Bobby!","50"

The chicken and pepper curry was absolutely delicious served by the very friendly and charismatic Bobby. He spent time chatting with us and taking great care and pride in his food explaining the origins and asking us how hot we would like it. He very kindly even gave his some of his mothers home made spice mix to take home. Lovely IPA to complement too. We enjoyed it so much we intended to return on our last day to take some back to the  UK but unfortunately couldn't make it. Would highly recommend if you fancy something different when in Copenhagen. Wonderful.","50"

The food itself was well prepared and homemade. This is definitely not an outstanding restaurant as the reviews indicate, but it not bad either and I would go again.   Overall, the restaurant lies somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.","30"
"Stephen P","My Dad once said, if it pleases your nose, then put it in your mouth! Obviously there are rules on this, though the essence remains.  I entered west market hoping to find something I could quickly eat before heading back to my hostel for bed... it didn’t go to plan... I was faced with many options, though when I smelt the aroma coming from Zahida, it was like a cartoon. As though a stream of scent picked me up by the nose and floated me toward to the counter. Then I got some real flavour... the charm and impact of Bobby. What a guy!  Bobby made me feel at home, explained to me where the recipes and the name came from and took away all the stress of the day... and that was whilst I awaited my food. Btw, the wait isn’t long. Through smart prep and a team that actually know what they’re doing, before you know it, you have a feast of taste before you, an amazing atmosphere and an enjoyable memory.   I’m going back next week.","50"

"Clarker63","Saw this on TripAdvisor and as we walked by we were drawn in by the banter from Shane and bobbi. They are very friendly mancunians with a great story to tell. Loved the chicken curry but it was too big for us to eat. They boxed it up and we had it the next day. Their beer was great too.. especially the lager. Sit at the counter and they will ask your names (and remember them) which is great. Very friendly service. Loved it!!","50"

"Roger S","I am visiting Copenhagen for a Friday night. Alone. Stomach growls and I want some Indian food. A google search sends me to Zahida at Westmarket. Good reviews. Infact very good reviews. Got to try it. Westmarket turns out to be an urban foodmarket with many ""foodbars"" inside a big building. If you are looking for a cozy restaurant with an intimate environment, go somewhere else. But if you are looking for an unique food experience accompanied with two truly enthusiastic brothers from Pakistan, go for it. You never feel alone at this ""restaurant"", that’s for sure. And the food...well, it still makes me smile. Friday I picked Zahidas curry chicken. The experience was so good that I had to get back Sunday with my girlfriend, before hitting the plane back to Oslo where we live.   PS: Cannot wait for a ""Zahidas sister"" finding its way to one of Oslos food markets :)","50"
"AKorns","Having moved to Denmark after living in the UK, it was near and impossible to find a decent curry, let alone find some spice/heat/flavour like Zahida's offers! Shane and Bobby brought over a piece of Manchester, now I can barely walk them in West Market to try a different place. The small menu to me means that their every single dish is just perfection. Richness of flavours, spices and aromas and all for a very reasonable price. I will definitely be visiting a lot...!","50"

This is an unexpected gem!","50"

Happy wife, happy life. The owner is a great guy who was engaging and very polite with lots of local tips.  We'd highly recommend you seek this place out and be ready to be pleasantly surprised by the high quality food and service from such a small outlet.","50"

"Teets1","So one day I visited to West Market. A newish food court establishment in Vesterbro. The place in general is great with many cuisines available.   Where do I land but this humble place serving Pakistani food. I get the lentil soup with rice. Some chilis to light it up a bit. Absolutely fantastic! I've now had it multiple times and have also tasted most of the rest of the menu which is equally fantastic.  What seems simple isn't. I've had the pleasure of watching the marinade be made, watch the lentils be blended, and have heard the story of these two talented brothers bringing their Mother's recipes to the rest of us. There is a quiet complexity to this food that I love.  Go enjoy. You won't be disappointed!","50"

"amanih376","I was looking for some Indian food when I read the reviews about this Pakistani food restaurant. We had Lentil soup with Chili, ginger and coriander. It was very delicious . The Samosa was really good and different from others I tried before; next time I will probably order some more. We finished our meal with Zahida's Curry platter. You can feel the taste of all spices in the sauce and the juicy chicken cubes. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the service is quick. If you like spicy food, then Zahida is the place to go.","50"
"Markus L","Mama Zahida, you can be proud of Bobby and his brother! We had the curry, soup, naan bread, and mango lassie - all of it exceptionally fresh & tasty. Just ask for tasting the soup and you will get stuck in this small, cozy place. Markus & Yvonne","50"
"pearliepie","We trekked across the city to get to this highly rated restaurant and it did not disappoint. Authentic, fresh, delicious Pakistani food served by a pair of fast talking, informative, friendly, enthusiastic brothers. Completely lived up to the hype but be careful not to bite into a slice of hot pepper!!!!","50"
"davewade12","Zahida is tucked away inside a unassuming shopping mall. We cycled there from our hotel, and we're greeted by Bobby, one of the brothers who started this restaurant off. We sat down and Bobby recommended the tandoori chicken, lamb chops and chicken curry with rice and naan. They also have have there own beer to complement the food. Bobby told us that all the food was based on his Mum's recipe's that she had taught him and his brother as children back in Manchester, England. The food was delicious, way better than many, many curries I have had in the UK. Full of flavour from the chilli, coriander and ginger, and free from the generic style of curries that I am used to. It's a small menu, but everything is cooked perfectly. What a shame there is only one Zahida, and it's in Denmark. Bobby was a great host, making every one feel comfortable and welcome, whether eating at the restaurant or taking food away.  I thoroughly recommend seeking this place out if you fancy some of Mum's finest Pakistani delights and happen to be in Copenhagen. You will not be disappointed! ","50"
"Alexandra G","The food was delicious! Mama Zahida should be very proud. Her sons are delightful and very talented with food! We will be back for more chicken curry, grilled chicken, and samosas. A true gem!","50"
"Christian R","I was nearby and looking for a place to eat. I checked TripAdvisor and ended here in this nice place in the West Market. The two boys from Manchester know what they are doing. They love what they do and you taste it in their meals. We had the curry, the chicken and the garlic naan. All were perfectly prepared. And the boys are always up for a conversation.   Also give the beer a try. It fits perfectly to their meals.   It is a place you should definitely not miss when you are around.","50"
"Starkaður A","I had the absolute pleasure of visiting Zahida with some colleagues and business associates during a conversation in Copenhagen. It's not your regular restaurant with large seating area so please don't expect one when you visit Zahida.

I am definitely going there again next time around, with a leg of lamb as promised! Amazing!","50"

The food is objectively pristine, but the service on top of it makes it an unforgettable experience. Highly recommend that you treat yourself. The burger also looks insane. Their home-crafted beer is also quite tasty.  All in all, you are doing yourself a disservice by not checking this place out. Treat yoself!","50"
"Mangesh P","This eatery is located in street food mall of Copenhagen . It is geared more to a take a way or a quick bite than a formal meal. The best thing about the place is the owner who wants to talk to you. The food is authentic and tastes good. The kebabs were great , dal . Chicken curry and nan were decent. The place is worth a try if you do not carry the expectation of best restaurant in Copenhagen.","40"
"Martin O","I love a good curry but hate the coloring and additives that sometimes go into the food. Zahida in Vesterbrogade market seems to avoid that and work on simple, fresh ingredients to provide a really satisfying curry. My wife had the Zahida curry and I had the Zahida chicken plus rice and Daal soup. All were delicious and also kudos to the hard-working guys behind the counter who create a good buzz and rapport with their customers. Nice one!","50"

"mmetteh","I think my expectations were a little too high going here knowing it was the number one rated restaurant in Copenhagen by tripadvisor.   We ordered the curry and a naan bread. It may be because I don't really have too much experience with pakistani food, but to me this seemed just like a good curry - but nothing out of the ordinary. It was a little too spicy for my taste, but that was to expect.   However the service was excellent. They were polite and very helpful.   All in all, a good dining experience, altough I was kinda dissapointed when my expectations was very high after reading the reviews on tripadvisor before eating there.","40"

"12AmyG","Zahida is a must-try. It was absolutely delicious. We had the mixed grill (lamb and chicken) and the daal rice. The food was fresh, flavorful, and incredible. It was very busy, and I was sad that I didn't get a chance to talk to the owners like many other reviewers. However, the owner did personally come out to our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Highly, highly recommended!!!","50"
"legkiy","Most people come here to check out no.1 rated restaurant in CPH. Just bear in mind it is essentially a small kitchen in a larger food court, you order at the bar and eat at a communal table (self-service). The food tastes excellent, I had a curry - just about the right level of spiciness, full of flavour. But due to a very busy day they ran out of rice, daal and lassi, so the dinner menu was basically a choice of 'meat and bread' (curry or grill, burger, and naan). The owner is extremely friendly. I hope they keep up the good job and thanks to tripadvisor success will be able to open a proper restaurant in the future, where I would come back with pleasure.","40"
"syzygy66","Perfect for a quick but delicious supper, Zahida has wonderful curry and other Pakistani specialties, served at the counter in this Vesterbro foodhall (or you can order takeout). The outgoing brothers who run it are terrific! No wonder this place has earned such high praise on TripAdvisor. If you're in the neighborhood, check it out. You won't be sorry!","50"
"Karen H","We always check out trip advisor for a good curry before going abroad. Zahida definitely deserves it's #1 spot. It was quiet as we were there early so one of the owners was able to talk to us about the kind of curry we like and make something to suit. We had chicken from the grill, chicken curry and naan. It was simply delicious and worth the long walk to find it. Relaxed atmosphere and a welcoming host. It is in Westmarket which you would easily walk straight past if you didn't know it was there. It looks like an office foyer from outside but is filled with foodstalls inside. We got to learn a bit about the start of Zahida, a very recently opened restaurant owned by two mancunian brothers, surprised by their quick rise to #1 status, following their mum's traditional pakistani recipes. You won't be surprised when you go. We also got to hear about places to visit in copenhagen all while eating flavoursome, stomach-pleasing food. Definitely worth visiting though they will surely be somewhere bigger very soon. If they are still at Westmarket make sure you turn on googlemaps, you don't want to miss it!","50"
"Nabeel11","Visited Zahida for lunch. The food was amazing, genuinely authentic Pakistani food and extremely tasty. Bobby and Shane provided an excellent service and were helpful with information about Copenhagen too! A must visit if you're in the West Market! Five stars!","50"
"Subhan M","As always, I had expectations high when I went to Zahida. The Affridi brothers greeted me with the best manners and started serving the food. Keep in mind I NEVER have had Lamp chops before - But the brothers ensured me that I was gonna love it. I was convinced and had the Lamp and Chicken Grill they serve, and my God, it was amazing! Delicious meat without fat, had an amazing taste, juicy.. I mean everything you could imagine. For those who are considering visiting Zahida, do yourself a favour and visit it. The Affridi brothers will definitely take good care of you.","50"
"nancyanngeorgeb","My first trip abroad, to meet up with my college kid who'd been backpacking Europe alone for over a month. We were determined to taste all the, ""best of"" that Denmark had to offer. Went to TA as usual, to scope out the best of the best. To say, Zahida earns it's number one spot, would be an understatement. My son and I biked to Zahida's to make it on a Sunday, for an early dinner knowing it would be closing at 5:00. Having arrived just before 4pm, we were so disappointed when the kind man behind the counter, (who turned out to be one of the two owners) told us they'd run out of food due to the onslaught of diners throughout the day. We had no shame about practically begging him for anything he might have left to serve us, just so we could brag to our friends back home about experiencing this culinary delight. He served us up two bowls of the most delicious lentil soup we'd ever tasted! The soup and the naan bread were very satiating and seasoned so beautifully. The owner even took time out to sit with us and tell us all about their history, and how determined they both were to make their mom proud by learning to prepare traditional Pakistani food for others to enjoy. Although we were leaving Copenhagen the next day and as such, couldn't revisit to enjoy all their specialty dishes, what a treat to have experienced a real, ""taste"" of what they're offering their guests. Love this place, for the incredible food and unique experience.","50"
"jessicafaddul","On my first trip to Copenhagen I visited Zahidas and it was probably the best part of the trip. First of all, the service is absolutley one of a kind. The two brothers who own the restaurant are so welcoming that you forgett about the food, and then when you taste the food you don't even want to leave. I went to Copenhagen again and my first stop was Zahidas. And I'll be back again soon!","50"
"Annemette P","I had the experience of trying Zahida this weekend. I had the Chicken Curry, the Zahida Chicken and the Garlic Naan for take away, and what a mouth-watering mix! I like that the meals are shareable and even the next day, the leftovers were very tasty and delicious. It's a must try! I am definitely going back!","50"
"thomasoZ7688NU","This place is one you have to go to! I had the best curry i have ever eaten and my girlfriend had the flaming lamb chops (best chops in the world!) Huge plus for having a custom brewed beer that goes perfect with the food! And last but not least both hands up to Bobby who sits and talks to you and lets you know everything about the food if you want! And to Bobby: i really hope you follow your plan and open a restaurant in Norway! :D","50"
"FellowTraveler717620","The best food in Copenhagen and one of the best services I have ever had! I really recommend this place!","50"
"Ida G","We walked for about 20 minutes or so, just to find out what all the fuzz was about. We read all about Zahida on TripAdvisor, and we are very happy we took the chance to visit the place. Kind of hard to find if you're not known in Copenhagen, but it sure was worth the walk. All in all amazing food and amazing service! Absolutely amazing. Never have I met such a staff at a restaurant. Bobby, you are an amazing host :) Thank you all for the perfect food and service. We will be back!!","50"
"Tina E","Best lambchops ever!!!!! Hot and spicy, And the crew is ever so friendly :-) I also tried the curry, which is great. I highly recommend it.","50"
"halldorags","I was surprised to find the meal really tasty and spicy when the restaurant looked like nothing I would have guessed to be this good. I hope the brothers who own this will find a more suitable place to serve this wonderful food. Loved it. But will not give it 5 stars due to tbe environment which affects the total outcome.","40"
"Simo V","First of all we were strugling to find the place as it is located inside market with many other restaurants.  Finally when we found the place, First we took house burgers and taste was absolutely amazing.  Then I spoke with Bobby about spiciest dish they would serve, he recommended me to take curry and made it extra spicy. That did not disappoint either, experience was definitely worth of 5/5 if not 6/5.  ","50"
"LyndsyAnn","Absolutely the best food I've eaten in my life. As eating is one of my favorite activities and I typically take culinary vacations, this is saying a lot. AMAZING and Bobby is extremely charming in addition to being a brilliant chef.","50"
"Steffen E","If you like food from Pakistan or for those who haven't experienced it yet comparable to the Indian kitchen, you should try this out. The owner / cook is really nice and offers a quality service . The place isn't that easy to find it is like a shopping / food market street.   Not like an ordinary Restaurant , but I really enjoyed the food and the service.  ","50"
"J1574CIthomasg","Really needless to say much more - magic taste. Very friendly and engaging owners. Highly recommend if you like spice tasty food.","50"
"Sigurd T","The friendliest staff, the best lamb chops I ever tasted, and a laidback atmosphere makes this a no-brainer at this cost. Ok, I had to wait a bit for the good, the beer was a 5 out of 6 and the naan could have been fresher I guess, but you just can't beat the overall impression. These guys deserve their 5 stars any day of the week. Perfect to grab a bite - not so much if you're looking for a 3-courde with silverware involved. Easily the best Pakistani meal I ever had.","50"
"Anastasia D","There are five dishes to choose from. We tried all of them and they were all equally amazingly tasty. Don't visit Copenhagen without eating here, you will regret it!!","50"
"Susanna V","We had amazing dal and chicken curry in Zahida! Owners are so friendly and professional. If you are looking for a amazing meal, Zahida is a place to be!","50"
"Robbie M","Bobby and the Boys clearly have a winning formula - and it is no surprise that they are sitting pretty at #1. We had such a great experience at Zahida - enjoying the fantastic food, company, atmosphere and hosts in equal measure.   I'd love to come back to Copenhagen and see the Zahida team on a much bigger scale - more people have to experience it.   Cheers Bobby - hope to see you soon mate.   Robbie Murray, London [June, 2017 visit]","50"
"Radoslav B","Hell yeah ... these guys are the best! the best food and customer service in the town! the food was just amazing plus we had a really nice talk with Bob :) I highly recommend you the chicken burger!","50"
"Peter M","My friend and I were visiting Copenhagen recently and discovered Zahida (via TripAdvisor). Based on the 100% positive reviews we decided to go therefor our Saturday dinner. Because of all the great reviews, we thought it would be important to make a reservation - we called and left a message. After a little difficulty finding the restaurant (it's located inside a mall), we were immediately greeted by one of two brothers that opened the restaurant just four months earlier. He asked about hour level of hunger, our food tastes, and spice-level preferences then recommended a mixed-grill dinner for us. Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Chops, Curry and Naan. OMG - we were blown away by the wonderful taste of each of the dishes as well as the personal attention we received. I had intended to try Momma's (chicken) burger (based on the reviews), but went with the suggested menu that night. My friend and I made a special point to return to Zahida the next day for lunch so that we could try their burger before we left Copenhagen later that day. We met the the other brother and learned more about their background (first-time running a restaurant, all family recipes). Again - WOW!!! Check this place when you're in Copenhagen","50"
"thecindyp","Can't think of one bad thing.. Best lamb I've had and the curry is simply stunning. Not only is the food good, the guys cooking it will cheer you up and give you a great experience.","50"
"Curious268863","Wow!!   First night in Copenhagen and the food for the rest of the trip sure has a lot to live up to!!  I had a burger and my wife had the curry, both of which were cooked to perfection!  Also, a special mention to Bobby who gave us some tips for our stay, and for the great service he provided.   Keep at it pal, you will soon have restaurants all over Scandinavia!!  P.S - Sorry I almost forgot to pay!! ","50"
"quantumcosmo","Dear Mother Zahida,  You have sons that are doing something special. My wife and I visited the restaurant named in your honor a couple of days ago as our last meal in Copenhagen. Everything met and exceeded our expectations. I understand your sons are mirroring their menu off of meals you served at home. They are doing such a great job at that!  The curry, chicken masala, and lamb chops were amazing. ""On point"" as we would say back here on the east coast of the USA. I love Indian/Pakistani food and I make an effort to eat it as much as possible and I have to say that the food your sons are serving are some of the best, if not THE best, I've had.  What your sons are trying to do is special. And I know you're proud of them. Please know they are making people VERY happy with the food they are cooking in your honor.  I know they may never fully meet your expectations (a mother should always want more and better from her sons), but they are meeting everyone else's.  The best food and experience my wife and I had on our trip to Copenhagen.","50"
"eqberry","Hands. Down. Amazing. From the food to the experience itself. It was such a delight to meet and be entertained by Bobby. He's warm, funny, and clearly passionate about what he does and it definitely shows in the quality of the food and the way he interacts with you. I loved watching him guide people through their food selections. Might as well just take what he suggests; you really won't be disappointed. This place is not to be missed if you're in Copenhagen, and I can't wait to go back next I'm there!","50"
"Sammy-boy1976","There's no need of thousand words to describe the greatness of this two bros and the quality of their food. I've never eaten Pakistan's food before and, after I know Zahida, I ate from them twice in 2 days. The quality of the food and the kindness and passion of these 2 guys are amazing.  If you want a taste (a very good one!) of Pakistan in a warm atmosphere, you've found the right place.  The best Curry in Copenhagen? Zahida's curry! Juicy, spicy and tasty, cooked and served with passion and love (but my son really loves Mama's House burger too ;-) ).   Highly recommended!   Thank you guys for my 'last meal' (for now) in Copenhagen. I'm looking forward to see you soon in the near future","50"
"joakimbe","Had the absolute experience ever with my friends celebrating my Italian friends birthday. I started writing this 5 star review as we got the great service, where the owner goes out to get the birthday boy a beer because they unfortunately sold out on their own, and I'm talking for free! By the end of this review I've tasted the amazing food and I stick with my 5 stars. To all those who are doubting to try this place, you're missing out and your life is empty and meaningless compared to us. Peace out, gringos!","50"
"upandeya","A friend recommended Zahida's to us and we were not disappointed. Amazing food and great service! The lamb chops are to die for! We tried the burger and the mango lassi, which were also delicious. Definitely recommend this place.","50"
"Joe V","Excellent, excellent, excellent. We thought it was a restaurant buts it's actually a little spot in the West Market food market. The staff (owners) are phenomenal. Friendly, engaging, and knowledgeable they explain what makes their food the best food in Copenhagen. We highly suggest meeting the brothers and eating their amazing homemade curries and other foods.","50"
"SBBetsy","This unassuming market restaurant deserves these rave reviews. The curry and tandoori chicken are amazing -- chicken served atop spinach drizzled with a mild chili citrus dressing. Unforgettable. Co-owner, Bobby, is a warm and humorous host. Be aware the address numbers are a bit confusing. This is a stall in a marketplace barely visible from the street. It's SO worth looking for!","50"
"gbbergmann","It's a very small place inside a food market. Excellent food. Well worth the visit. It only has a few things on the menu so for vegetarians Dahl soup is the option","50"
"Abhinav T","As an Indian person in Copenhagen, I have spent the last few months desperately trying to find Indian/Pakistani food that at least remotely tastes like food that I am used to. I did not expect Copenhagen to be a mecca of Indian food but neither was I expecting such poor overall quality across many restaurants.  It was to my great surprise and delight then that I came across Zahidas by chance and tried it. The tandoori chicken and dal are absolutely amazing (probably the best I've had outside India) and the owners (shout out to Bobby) are incredibly friendly and warm. I have already visited Zahidas thrice over the past two days and I do not see this trend slowing down any time soon.   As someone who had almost given up finding good Indian food in Copenhagen, I am absolutely thrilled that I encountered Zahidas by chance and will continue to be back here on a regular basis!","50"
"craigcargill","Cross between a cafe and a street food place within an indoor market. Menu is small and perfectly formed. Recommend the mixed grill starter - disposable gloves provided to ensure you get hands on with the lamb chop! One choice of curry which is no problem as it was simply excellent. Fantastic and passionate host in Bobby (not sure of spelling) - he and his brother basically cook you their mum's recipes - great job guys. Keep it up, I'll be back next time I'm in town.","50"
"580ammara","I have been a regular at Zahida's for a few months and I must say, wow. It was love at first lamb chop and now I come regularly a few times a month. The owner/cook is extremely friendly and knows exactly how to treat his customers. A total ""Go out and get it now"" review from me.  /A","50"

"soniamW3546QB","Had an amazing meal here - deliciously complex and spicy meat flavors, intoxicatingly fragrant rice, and buttery naan. Totally hit the spot. Healthy, flavorful, and fresh food served by people who care about their craft and their customers. If you're in the area, make sure to check it out!! You can also get a post-meal G&T, coffee, or dessert right nearby, which makes it a no-brainer. Highly recommend and I'm pretty picky!","50"

"BowieV5","ZAHIDA might very well the best spot for tasty and spicy food served by the best guys in the business!  The lamb chops are amazing with rice and naan-bread - It's simple and tasteful (if it gets too spicy the mango lassi will save you) The brothers running the place are passionate, pleasant and talkative - never a dull moment/conversation at ZAHIDA Bring your friends, family or go get some food yourself - always worth the trip! You won't find a more caring crew and the food is excellent!","50"

The best lamb chops, chicken pieces and chicken curry we've ever had. And as a finisher (and since im a hungry guy), i had the most amazing burger experience in my entire life, with the ""Mama's House Burger"".   The word ""tender"" have gotten completely new meaning in my vocabulary after the first bite!  My highest recommendations goes to Zahida, and i urge everyone who's nearby and have a heart for a spicy and authentic experience, to drop by and try it.  5 out of 5 possible for Zahida, and the great atmosphere.  Jesper","50"
"Meadhbh N","Best curry spot in New Market and probably Copenhagen! We didn't get a chance to try the grill but it also looked delicious.

"AFoodFreaker","Tucked inside the hip West Market is Zahida. They only make five main dishes (eat there or take out) but each of the options are exquisite. The restaurant is named after the Mother of the owners who seems to have carefully and perfectly taught her sons the magic of Pakistaní cooking. The food is like eating perfume for your taste buds.","50"
"WilfreddeRoos","Have to admit, most of the small restaurants in Westmarket look attractive. They all present their dishes (see what you eat) nicely. Zahida's curry was very tasteful, even the rice was flavoured. Fast service and far above fastfood quality. Curry, rice, naan and mango lassi for 170dkk is a bargain in Copenhagen.","50"
"Mette K","The beautiful brothers who run the magnificent first class street food restaurant, serving you, not only with the supreme loving energy that will surround your senses, but you are in for a special treat at Zahida. The lamp chop (not from frozen; always fresh!) are a Devine experience, so tender you will pinch your arm, to know if you are dreaming! I have tried all there delicious on the menu and are still coming back for more. With family and friends I been at fine (even some Michelin) restaurants in Copenhagen as well as London, Spain, France ect. and have a blast trying out the 'street food markets' wherever I go; and Zahida is right up there, in the high stars; one can only hope for the brothers to open up more Zahida's in Copenhagen and worldwide! Thank you so much, I wish you the greatest success!","50"

"suzannebX2475IA","Really great surprise eating at Zahida. Just around the corner from our Airbnb in the Westmarket. Used to good spicy food in Amsterdam just loved their deeply flavored and marinated tender and spicy lamb on top of fresh spinach with garlic. Combined with rice and a bit of the dahl as a sauce: awesome. Home made Mango lassi to dim the peppers. Afraid we ordered too much but four of those delicious lamb pieces a person were gone before you know it. The owners are attentive with good humor. Please set up a franchise in Amsterdam soon!!!!","50"
"John L","It's difficult to add to the comments already made other than to agree 100% with them.  I went to Zahidas just after it opened and am now hopelessly addicted to the fabulous food that the boys relentlessly prepare. There must be 20 or 30 other food options in West market but I can't walk past Zahidas without eating there. Shane and Bobby, the charismatic owners have a great story. Their mother (after whom the restaurant is named) produces home cooked food that they loved so much that they wanted to share it with others. And I, for one, am delighted and very fortunate that they did. The signature dish is the Zahidas Curry. Insanely delicious whether with rice, nan bread or both (recommended). And for those that love a great Chicken Burger, with a Pakistani twist, then look no further. And the lamb chops and Daal................ And the guys genuinely care about their customers. Expect hugs, fist pumps and some great banter. So if you are living in Copenhagen or just visiting then please come and share my addiction. New members to 'Zahidas anonymous' are welcome!","50"

Shane and Bob will sweep you off your feet with their boyish charm and their rugged good looks. If you have yet to enjoy a meal at Zahida, I honestly don't know what you're doing with your life. INCREDIBLE!","50"
"Mariana S","If you go to Zahida you will enter the most welcoming and loving atmosphere I have seen in a long time. Other than that this is the best Pakistani food, I have had in Copenhagen so far. Everything is fresh and home cooked, so it's definitely worth a visit in my opinion. You will not regret it!","50"
"Lonnie C","Close your eyes and just pick something on the menu. It is that good. It is outstanding, in fact. Zahida serves the most authentic, precisely flavoured and delicious Pakistani food in town. Good preparation,great taste and great service. Thanks guys, I definitely plan on eating here again.","50"
"Maria R","This place deserves a flaming review for the spicy, tasty, flaming grill, for the crispy, juicy deliciousness, and for the fresh, full-of-love food that they serve at this amazing joint. The signature chicken curry is to die for, it is so deep in flavour and the spices are open and warmed up under the perfect amount of heat. Juicy chicken, tasty spices and just.... Try it! And the house burger from Zahida... Hands on my heart - Best burger I've ever had, and it is a chicken-burger?! Nevertheless, it is great. Not just the chicken ut every paert of the burger, from bun to breading. An absolute winner! (Go double if you love food, and are hungry as hell). This is a great example of authenticity combined with passion, love and lots of knowledge of tastes and flavours - and food of course. The two brothers who own the place, work their behinds off, to serve something that is equally delicious every time. They've found the key to consistency - and they love what they do, which comes through in the flavorful food. Spectacular place, and so recomendable for anyone currently in Copenhagen; who likes amazing food and great company in terms of the two funny, polite, attentive and great as hell brothers standing behind the counter. Amazed!","50"

"Sarah_Kosher_Kitchen","Zahida's two enthusiastic, service minded sons prepare and serve the most tasteful, spicy, honest Pakistani street food in Copenhagen at the moment. We had Zahida's (the name of their mother) curry with chicken and lamp chops + a taste of their dahl. All very, very delicious and a significant experience, you shouldn't miss out on. They do take away too. Zahida must be proud.","50"

"Judielykke","Shane and Bobby, brothers, opened this beautiful comfort pearl in Westmarket. They call the place Zahida and soon I will return because then Zahida, their mom, will be by the stove. We had a perfect lunch digging into beautiful lamp chops, a perfect curry and moist chicken from the grill. See you soon for more love on a plate! <3","50"
"FrederikW22","Located in westmarket the new place to be in Copenhagen, Zahida dishes out multiple dishes of very high quality to very reasonable prices!  It is managed by two very open and friendly brothers who will joke and tell you lots of stories while you eat. The curry is fantastic and so was the burger. GO","50"
"Teemo A","I could recommend this place for the lads behind the counter alone. With the general service level in Denmark being low at times, it's a rare thing to meet people who are this warm and friendly. You forget you haven't been friends all your life when you talk to them.   That aside, doesn't matter if you're having the house burger, the curry dish or the sticks. The chicken is juicy and succulent, and the curry packs a punch. It's a strong curry, but never so strong it numbs your tongue though, which means you get to savour every last bite.   The lads clearly know what they're doing, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better curry in Copenhagen.   Also, that homemade Mango Lassi. Stop reading this, just go eat there.","50"
"David C","Dropped in to try the lamb chops but ordered the whole menu!  We ordered a double portion and 6 decent sized, flame grilled chops hit the spot!   Shane is a great chef, Bobbi a real character.   We had the tandoori chicken and a house curry as well as a secret tour of the spices and rubs. Bobbi threw in a Naan and some Dal too :-)  Great new spot in KBH","50"
"Kathryn B","A friend and I went to Copenhagen for the weekend and chanced upon this little gem on the first morning. The food was so good and the service so charming, we went back twice... Don't know why it isn't in the guide books - it's a great food experience.","50"
"FunkyBhudda","Zahida, beautiful food, prepared and served by beautiful people in a warm, friendly, family atmosphere. Shane and Bobbi provide the perfect company for their delicious, gourmet cuisine. Mama's house burger is the best chicken burger I have ever eaten. Check it out, you will not be disappointed.","50"
"KristelO21","Definitely a must try place when in Copenhagen. Try their super tasty curry and flamed chops or mamas house burger - you won't regret! 😋Good food, good people!👌🏼","50"
"Sanni B","Quality food and you feel very welcome like you were actually visiting the Pakistan family <3 Recommending Mama's house burger!","50"
