"S1452BYalexandraf","Gorgeous restaurant in a beautiful location! Staff was really nice and nothing was too much trouble for them. Pizza was one of the best I ever experienced outside Italy. Owners are real Italians and you can feel La Dolce Vita here! I really recommend it.","50"
"persilj4","We went for dinner without a reservation, and they were fully booked. However, they suggested we could start outside, and move inside when they got a table of us, which was very nice. Their three-course menu with wines was very delicious and a really good value for money. The service was very pleasant throughout the evening. My only complaint is about the portion sizes - they were rather big for a three-course menu and I hate wasting food. Luckily everything was very good and husband was happy to help.","50"
"553gunap","MaMeMi is SIMPLY AMAZING. Off the beaten path, you'll find some of the most delicious Italian food in Copenhagen.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Copenhagen not just because of the food, but also because of the atmosphere. The Italian vibe makes you feel like you're a part of the family.  And then comes THE FOOD! It simply keeps getting better and better every time I go there. The latest highlights include the meatballs and parmigiana. SO GOOD!  It's not always easy to get a table on the weekends, so make sure you book in advance.","50"
"Mariaspangse","The best pizza I’ve ever tried. Exclusive wines. Well trained staff, very helpful and sweet. We are definitely coming back.","50"
"sasuke80","When you want pizza you should go for Italians, and this place is run by 3 very committed Italians who deliver a great service besides a delicious pizza. The prices are absolutely fair and they have also a great selection of wines since one of the three guys is an experienced sommelier. To be recommended: you are not going to find a better pizza in Copenhagen!","50"
"365giornidicibo","Mamemi is a cozy place to spent the evening. I had a super pizza with asparagus cheese and poached egg , the dessert was a creamy “crema catalana”, just gorgeous. The atmosphere at Mamemi was relaxing, right music and soft lights. The assortment of wine is very very good. The guys from the staff were frendly, they made me feel at home.  Mamemi is definitely the place to go.","50"
"648holly","It's lovely inside and very cosy, but we were very disappointed with our meal. I'm a vegetarian so my only option was the marinara pizza (80dkk), upon ordering the waiter asked if i wanted it with mozzarella as it doesn't come with cheese at all, which cost an extra 30dkk (making the pizza approx £12 in total). When it arrived, it was a pizza base, tomato sauce (which had NO flavour to it) and sprinkles of mozzarella which hadn't been cooked onto the pizza. It was the most flavourless, boring pizza I have ever eaten, and I cannot get over the price that they're charging for what is essentially a margherita. It's even pricier than pizzas with pancetta and pork cheek on. My boyfriend got the pizza with the pork cheek and apple, thinking it would have small slithers on apple on. It came out covered in large slices of an entire apple, with bits of pork underneath so it overpowered the whole thing.","20"

Very good service, and kid-friendly, especially for us arriving early.","50"

"GGlen78","Having now lived in Denmark for a number of years, and have until very recently only been disappointed by the standard of pizza available in Denmark- which has ranged from average to downright disgusting. Until now- a great little gem in Vesterbro with Italian staff who take pride in serving great pizza. ","40"

"emjigrs","This pizzeria does live up to the expectations! It really deserves its notation and rank on here :) The menu if small, you can choose from 6 pizza which I like. The recipes are really out there, I’ve definitely never seen such pizza anywhere else in my life. I chose the pizza with pork cheek, balsamic, caramelized onions, Italian cheese and apple. Don’t be afraid of this mix tho, it tastes really amazing!! Also the prices are really decent for the size and quality of the food.  The restaurant is very cute, the location is pretty convenient, near the central station.  The service was really quick, the staff is excellent, super friendly, professional, efficient and really comprehensive. I wish I had stayed longer but I had a bus to catch.","50"
"jacobsecher","WoW, what an exprince. As a educated waiter myself, who takes pride in what I do. I have to say that visiting this restaurant sets what I think should be the standard of service in EVERY. I didnt know what to expect, found the restaurant here on TripAdviser. Its like stepping into a little peice of italy in the mids of Copenhagen. Entering the restaurant you will get a very nice sent of italy, when we where there I felt like we where the only ones speaking danish/Norwegian the rest of the guest was Italian. And if they come to eat here it most be good. And it was. Small selection of pizza, but our waiter (youngest of the family buisness) told us that this way they could change the meny every week, which I really like. We had 2 beautiful starters and a pizza each. The waiter found us a really good red wine in the price range we asked for. I had a dessert and got offered a really nice desert wine afterwards and two coffees after again. We went to sit in the bar for a last glass of wine to finish of the evening and the same waiter came and talk to us and suggested us a really nice glass of white wine which was perfect after a good dinner. Not once during dinne did we have to pour either water or wine our self, he was an amazing waiter and again, being a waiter by education myself, this is what its all about, seeing the guest, helping the guest to have a combination of gpod food and high service, a total experience where everything is in perfect harmony, and again WOW what and experience we had.  Will I recommend this place YES DIFFERENTLY.","50"
"Marro","Chalk up another win to The Fork - made finding and booking this place so easy, and as we were visiting the day before New Year's Eve and they were having to turn away people without reservations, the certainty of knowing a table was reserved was priceless. As is the wine in Copenhagen, almost - goodness, it's pricey. But MaMeMi has excellent choices by the glass, and super pizzas to match. The lightest pizza bases I've ever tasted, quite amazing. And an unusual but really interesting mortadella pizza makes for a great option, especially with the sheer quantity of meat on the thing. A special word for the owner/waiter on our visit - really welcoming, helpful, nice guy. Sorry I didn't catch the name to thank him publicly, but he's a co-owner.","50"

"Westisch","I was at Pizzeria Mamemi with a friend yesterday and had a marvelous experience. The venue is stellar, great atmosphere.   We had the tasting menu, presented with excellence by our waiter (unfortunately I didn’t get his name but he has shaven hair on the sides and a sleeve tattoo. Terrific guy).   1. First up was mussels cooked according to their grandmothers recipe. “A lot of pepper” I want to remember it was called, and it sure was a lot of pepper but most definitely one of the best blue shells I’ve ever had. Steamed in salt water, with garlic and pepper. Served alongside with two wines from a district 50km east of Naples. Great choices, I especially enjoyed the one with an acidic touch along with the mussels. Presented as every time with dedication and knowledge by our waiter.   2. Next stop was a pizza with a special pickled red onion, mozzarella, some hazelnuts and an anchovie-kind of-sauce (it was called something special). It was extraordinary. Completely perfect. The sauce together with the cheese and onion blended like Hendrick’s and tonic. It was great. Two other wines were served, one natural wine that was a nice special treat with the pizza. Fantastic wines once again, especially the natural wine which me and my company enjoyed the most. Presented once again with pleasure by our waiter.   3. The menu was now over but we ordered some cheese and an espresso to finish. When we ordered the cheese our waiter convinced us to try a special red wine with the cheese which we gladly accepted. It would come as no surprise that it was great.   Afterwards we drank our coffee and noticed that the last wine and coffee were on the house. I was stunned, and we left the restaurant extremely happy and content. 10/10. Will most definitely come again soon!  (To the waiter). Don’t know if you’re reading this but thanks once again for the great experience man. It was perfect!   /Mr. Oscar   ","50"
"Duckbill","I chose this place to have a dinner based on review on tripadvisor. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as great as it had been described here. First of all, a poor choice of pizzas. Their Margherita looked for me like a dough with splashes of cheese, covered with smeared tomato paste and that all slightly heated up. I mean I’m not a food blogger or something but Margherita from Lidl has more ingredients. Then, waiters are kind of overplaying. That place is not as fancy as waiters are pretending to be. that looks very awkward eventually.  However, I should notice, it is cheap after all. Less than 18e for pizza and a glass of wine.","20"
"572kaanc","Came here after reading the reviews on here. Was absolutely made up with our experience, the staff were so welcoming and friendly. The wine was very good, and the pizzas were genuine and authentic Italian style ! Would definitely return here! Go see for yourself...","50"

"TaraJ441","Wow! Just visited Copenhagen for the first time on my own. Had diner at Pizzeria MaMeMi. I ordered a pizza from their menu with an unsual combination of ingredients. As a surprise I got a free starter: Mashed beans with herbs and toast. Served beautifully and tasted delicious. After that I got the pizza I ordered. The way it looked was equal to the way it tasted: unbelievably. All the different flavours fitted perfectly together. They checked several times how I was and how the food was. Not in a disturbing way, but in an honest, caring way.   They asked me if I wanted a dessert. The pizza was actually enough, but I wanted to check the menu (just in case). My favorite dessert: creme brulee. I told Vincent, the man who made my diner an evening full of pleasent surprises, that I needed some time to be less 'full'.   A couple of minutes later he surprised me again with a free tea with lemon, orange, ginger and honey. My smile grew and grew over the evening.   Then the dessert: beautifully served creme brulee with an amazing taste. And again.. Surprise! A free moscato that fitted perfectly with the dessert.   Honestly, this is the best diner-experience I've ever had. Thank you so much Pizzeria MaMeMi for everything. A special thanks to Vincent who made me leave the restaurant with a big, big smile.   GRAZIE MILLE!","50"
"Vincent L","I 've discovered them when they were yet in the Westmarket, and it was already a great experience to enjoy them, in their pizzeria. They had already a great level of pizza and selection of wines, but yesterday i've been to their new location , Winebar Mamemi' in Mysundegade 28 and i felt in love since the first second i've arrived to the entrance . When you enter in this pizzeria, the first thing that you feel, it's to enter in a familiar place, cozy , warm . Then there is the great welcome of the entire staff. The menu was really rich and elaborated and the wine list, what a great italian wine list!! I 've never seen before a list as this one. It's composed by only little producers, with organic and biodinamic philosophies . I was really excited about all the complex. Than i've ordered a delicious beef tartare served with a porcini mayo, a pizza n 3 ( best pizza ever ate ) , a cheese selection , composed by 4 cheeses (vesteahost , grana padano 36mesi, fourme d'Ambert e un pecorino romano) and some home made confiture and chutney. I've drunk ,thanks to the suggestion of Danilo ,owner and sommelier , a Greco di tufo Pietrarosa produder by Di Prisco. This wine was immense!!  Thanks to Mamemi', continue in that way !!  You are great guys.","50"

"jasjnc","Fantastic dinner at Mamemi just off of Istegade (use TripAdv nav btw - NOT Apple Maps). It is thin crust personal pizza at its best. As a frequent “lonely businessman” here (figure 8-10 trips a year for many years) this is easy, delicious and better than all the other pizza I’ve had in DK.  The waiter was very helpful on the 5-6 different pizza types and, while I didn’t have the room / courage for the hearty sausage, truffle cream and cremini mushroom pie, he suggested a very delicious pork jowel, smoked Gouda, sautéed red onion and apple slice pizza - drizzled with some balsamic. I left nary a crumb...  Also they served me a very tasty starter taster and then ended with a small sample of their tirimisu. It was heavenly.   If you’re up for pizza and are near center city, give this place a chance.","50"

"Runwiththebigdog","I went their with my wife and kids on a recent vacation from the U.S. We found this place as it was walking distance from our apartment rental. We were looking for something affordable (by Copenhagen standards) and this place was highly rated. We ordered two pizza's as we had flown all day and were starving. Glad we did as the pizza size is not ""large"" from a US perspective, and one pizza was enough for 2 adults. One pizza was with mozzarella, eggplant and capers which was a hit for us. The second was with a spicy salami, peppers and olives. This one, I liked but it was spicier than even I expected and my kids wouldn't finish theirs. Not a problem as I finished off theirs ;o). Note it was a little difficult to find as it was toward the back of an indoor market so it took a little extra wandering to find it. It's worth it if you are looking for reasonably priced food, but order accordingly if you are hungry.","40"
"Miguel Ángel V","My family and I were visiting Mamemi as usual when we want to have the best pizza and best service. No words for the pizza with that mousse of mushrooms...Definitely I advice to all of you to visit them and just enjoy of the pleasure of eat a real italian pizza. Congratulations!!!","50"
"EricNJulia","Found this restaurant while looking for a moderately priced restaurant in Copenhagen. It is a little bit hidden, as located inside a market. It looks desert when you're in front of the market but just go in, follow the alley and you will find the lovely restaurant on the side. There is table service if required, and overall we had an amazing time. Prices are very low compared to the rest of the city, and the pizza we had were delicious ! The waiters were friendly and efficient given that they have to deal with both table service and take-away orders. A true hidden gem that's well worth visiting.","50"
"J C","The pizza was really good - crisp crust with awesome toppings, very flavorful. The ambience was young/energetic/hustle/fun. Beer was cold, wine was good. The hosts/owners even gave us shots of lemoncello! All in all a warm/friendly/delicious experience. Highly Recommend while in Copenhagen.","50"
"kim s","The few options they had were mostly well executed but I still missed the great classics to mix in with the new. Wouldn’t mind going there again but not on my priority list","30"
"David B","They are finally moving out of the West Market which is much needed! The pizza was delicious (we really liked #2 and #4). We also all really enjoyed the bruschetta and panna cotta (yum!) The food was a little pricey, but it is best if you get the deal with the bruschetta, pizza, dessert (panna cotta) and drink. The workers are all super friendly! They are also helpful to pick out what to get (even though the selection is not the biggest.) We definitely would go again and recommend to anyone!","50"
"440zahids","We went here for dinner after reading all the reviews. Westmarket is definitely not an easy place to get to, you need to take the metro or train in and then either bus or walk for 15min. The market itself isn’t great, lots of closed stalls. But once you get to Mamemi the pizza makes it well worth it. They call it ‘Roma’ style in that it’s a thin pizza with a crispy crust and a soft (but not soggy) inside. Limited number of choices (6 pizza to choose from) but they are flexible with toppings to suit your taste. Reasonably priced as well. And service is very friendly. Worth a try if you are in the area.","50"
"TheHungrySeal","Pizzeria Mamemi's location is a bit unconventional in that it is not a standalone restaurant. It is located in a shopping mall and remains open even when other stores are closed. When I first saw the place, I thought there was a problem with the Google Maps as I walked pass a series of empty stores. How could a delicious looking pizza come from a shopping mall especially when almost all the stores are closed?   Rest assure, this was not a mistake. I ordered Pizza Number 4 (pork cheek, asparagus and cheese) with a small draft beer imported from Italy. All the toppings well together and the best part was the homemade dough that brings all the toppings together. The dough paired extremely well with the dark malty draft beer.   Overall, the pizza was delicious and the service was nice. The only downside is location, but I do not fault the owners or staff because real estate can be very costly. I rather have a nice experience in a hidden location than a mediocre experience in a convenient and easy to find location. Definately recommend.","50"

"JulianPCork","Ignoring the dilapidated ruin of WestMarket that MaMeMi Pizzeria is situated in, this is simply an amazing pizzeria. The menu consists of only six pizzas chosen by the owners which are far from conventional but are justified by how brilliant they are. We loved the potato and Pancetta pizza, but in reality we'd recommend them all - we felt obligated to go back and visit a second time during our time in Denmark. Expect thin, crispy bases, a nice seating area both inside and out, and friendly Italian owners who are extremely talkative and love feedback. Simply sublime and a must visit in Copenhagen.","50"

Seeing such positive reviews we gave it a go, and I can assure you you will not be disappointed.  The menu is short, just 5 pizzas to choose from, but they are just unbeatable. We went for both the apple and the salmon one, and could not decide which one was best. If you are around, and get the chance to pay this place a visit, absolutely do it.","50"
"TimoT33","I walked to see Westmarket and had something for a dinner.  I took the menu with red wine. First came red wine which was nothing special. Bruscetta was nice for a starter but I thought high ratings in Tripadvisor were too much. After that came pizza (with spicy salami) and the taste was exceptionally good - just amazing. Dessert was ok as well.  Due excellent service and great pizza this deserves 5 stars! I will definitely come back. Reasonably priced as well.","50"

So, don’t expect the traditional names on the menu.

I still recommend it, but don’t expect a starred restaurant experience.","30"

It has more of a Danish food market vibe than a full on restaurant. There was only a choice of 5 pizzas but oh my they were tasty!! They also do wines and beers. The wines were expensive but in line with the rest of Copenhagen. The beers were good but they were smaller than pints. The guys who worked there were very attentive and gave us a complementary bit of pizza as an appetiser and limoncello to finish. Overall awesome pizza and awesome service!","50"

"747gabriellaa","Francesco is a very good host, he makes the best pizza in Copenhagen. We've tried 4 out of 6 pizzas he has on the menu and all of them were delicious. He perfectly combines danish tastes with the traditional Italian pizza. Thank you again Francesco, see you next time!","50"
"Stephen B","Oh my! Read about this place before visiting Copenhagen on business. Looking for decent quality, good value vegetarian options. What a find. I ate here 2 out of 3 nights. The guys (all Italian) have only 6 pizzas on the menu, but 3 were vego and without doubt the best pizza I have had, certainly outside of Italy, maybe anywhere. Fabulous thin but not too crispy base, super fresh, simple ingredients. Combine this with a couple of killer fraught beers, best panacotta ever and wonderful friendly service. I want to go back to Denmark for this pizza!","50"
"Bentley M","A great pizza place in Torvehallen.  I saw an ""buy 1 get 2 pizza"" ad on a deal site, so I decided to give it a try.  It didn't take that to receive the order and the pizza was made quickly. I ordered the classic potatoes, pancetta, and rosemary. It was delicious. Though, personally, my mouth just can't deal with any kind of crusty dough. It might be just because I don't know or still need to practice more on how to eat it properly without hurting the inside of my mouth.  Being a person who enjoys eating anything with some kind of chilli condiment, I was almost tempted to ask whether they have a bottle of chilli sauce, but I figured this was how you supposed to enjoy the pizza.  Like I said, I liked it and my husband liked his pizza as well.","40"

Believe me, you CAN'T stop yourself and as silly as it sounds, I am just so thankful the summer is over and I don't have to worry about my summer body anymore :D !  The atmosphere is great, the guys make you laugh and there you are, just feeling great, enjoying your pizza and crafted Italian beer! What else to ask for? Ah, yes, they have also panna cotta! Ask for that! :D  On more serious note - the stall is great, the atmosphere is cozy, staff super friendly, pizzas are delicious and when this all comes together - you just suddenly understand why they say Danish is the happiest nation - because they have Mamemi!  It's really worth a ride or walk over there, and enjoy!","50"
"Alistair B","You would easily walk past the anonymous entrance to the indoor food and restaurant market for Mamemi. Don't. Four adults and two children were served best-ever pizzas and my six-year old grandson is a pizza gourmet. Brilliant service and a restricted menu ensures an excellent meal. Perched on high stools, the beautifully cooked thin crust pizzas were utterly delicious.","50"

Some got their pizza (only make 5 types) and took it outside to eat in courtyard sitting on curb and some had take-away. Worth the wait and also the #1 place is also in the market. We tried three types of pizza between the four of us and were full.","50"

The menu has five different pizzas that change from time to time. But don't worry. If you found your favourite, you'll find a new one.  I myself can't stop coming here.","50"
"erikf260","The pizzas at Mamemi are amazing and the guys are great too! The beauty is the simplicity... The menu is small, but they often rotate the pizzas around so you will always have fresh new options. From the flour, to the toppings, to the beer and the wine- everything is sourced directly from Italia! Best pizza in town without question!","50"

The staff are always smiling and ready to help you out with anything you need, weather is a suggestion on the pizza or what wine goes best with you choice of pizza! And today I also tried their homemade pannacotta, which I am usually very picky about it as it is my favourite dessert. And let me tell you, it was amazing! One of the best pannacotta I've ever had! So, if you are looking for a pizza in Copenhagen, I strongly suggest you to try out MaMeMi!","50"

"kikerael1988","Amazing!!! What else can I say... Not just because of it is the first time I find out real Italian pizza in CPH...It is also because the place, the lovely service and the incredible pricing (less then 100DKK per pizza) makes this place one of the best discovery I have ever found in the city!  100% recommended as they usually change their menu every week!

I have taken my friends and family out there for countless times already and everyone agrees, - once you try their pizza, you will be craving it for forever!  I strongly suggest to try this place out, the atmosphere is relaxed, Italians are chatty and food is unbelievable!  Wishing all the best!  ciao! A.","50"
"DaniloRignano","I love eating pizza. Its my favorite meal. So I aleays start with margarita. But the dough stuck in my head until the next day. How do they do to make a pizza so airy and crunchy? And the tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella just jinx you from ever wanting to eat any other pizza anywhere else. They have five options and the margarita is just a choice for the sceptic, but the five choices are loring. They even have a choice of pork with caramelized onion and apple and smoked cheese after the oven. Guys, I have no words to describe this. Its energetically renovating! The best pizza l've ever had, and not just in Copenhagen! Thank you, Mamemi. Thank you!","50"
"nicomh1","This happened in Mamemi Pizzería, west market, Copenhagen. I mean, this has to be by far the best pizza I've ever tried in my life. For starters, they only had 5 options of pizza; so I thought, that has to be good. The place was very nice Italian looking, and the hosts make you feel you're in Rome. I ordered the bestseller: potatoes, fresh mozzarella, bacon and rosemary - I couldn't loose!...and I didn't! It was as crunchy as it was tasty. My goodness!! No excessive taste. A mix of classic and yet innovative. I was served a glass of Bardolino, Italian wine. It slid through my throat as smooth as a soft, tender caress. Heavenly! The next day I brought my girlfriend and we tried red pizza with eggplant, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella and some chili oil. Just the blend of colors will get you; but the taste is unique.   Bravo guys, I'll go to your restaurant for the big opening!","50"

"Garu84","One of the best pizza I ever tried. I'm a fan of thin crust, and here I get a very nice one, topped with fresh ingredients and tasty combinations. I do like the fact that they change the combinations often, experimenting with unusual ingridients. I already been there many times, and never been disappointed (I wanted to wait before writing a review to see if they are consistent). The service, in my opinion, is generally quite speedy and professional, even when the number of customers is high. Only pity is the lack of seats, which translates in going around looking for a free spot during busy days, but this is not their fault, as they belong to WestMarket (at least there is a common area with tables).","50"
