"Christopher B","Friendly cosy staff and best sandwiches in town - highly recommended for everyone! If you are here on vacation, dont miss this fantastic place","50"
"Bauto","After a ride to Dragor and having seen that this place had such high ratings, we decided to come and check It by ourselves. The Guy there explained us how It worked and we ordered two avocado chicken sandwich. They were big, tasty and not expensive. The rate they got is totally deserved and we ended Up having a great meal.  Special thanks to the waiter who was so kind that I would married him if he had asked. Really, a VERY nice Guy.","50"
"juliaemk_18","Not only were the sandwiches absolutely delicious - the owners were unbelievable - provided charging cables, map of sites to see in Copenhagen and free little treats! Highlight of the trip this far.","50"
"alexmchattie","We went here for lunch to have a sandwich and couldn’t have loved somewhere more. They explained the menu as well as explaining what they had to offer, as well as giving us a sheet of things to do and places to go. The restaurant also has chargers and heaters at the table as well as available WiFi. We will be going back","50"
"acemalik","I was starving as soon as I woke up, and googled a good place to eat. Seriously, walking from the center to Grams was the best idea. Great food and absolutely amazing staff. They helped me with the choices and I enjoyed the food a lot.","50"
"Carole C","Would definitely recommend, went there on our first trip to Copenhagen after reading the good reviews and we weren't disappointed. Great food, freshly prepared and served with a smile. Made to feel very welcome, and would have loved to have gone back the next day but we weren't in the vicinity. Our party of five, all had sandwiches, and they were delicious, with lovely fresh bread and tasty fillings. We were given some free shots of ginger cordial which was also delicious and a nice touch. There was antibacterial on the table for your hands which I thought was a really good idea. Give it a try, I'm sure you will be pleased you did.","50"
"RebeccaM3771","We found this little gem by accident and I must say it was the best lunch we had, the 5 days we spent in Copenhagen. The staff was extremely friendly, the place was really cozy and the food was freshly prepared. Everything we needed after a morning out in the rain..   ","50"
"joeldriver","We stumbled upon this place by accident looking for a late breakfast. They do great sandwiches and they are very welcoming. They are near a school so every so often about 10 kids came into to order sandwiches which was quite funny for such a small shop. This didn’t affect our experience at all","50"
"llaxof","We had some soup as they have run out of other food. The soup was very tasty and the people who worked there was very hospitable! Would recommend..","50"
"katiecorno","These guys are the best. I was out of my mind hungry after spending the morning traveling into Copenhagen and ended up here because it was close to my hostel and looked cheap. As soon as I walked in, one owner noted my luggage and...More","50"

"E9806UXlaurad","Handmade to order. Delicious coffee also. The owner gave us a free shot of delicious cordial and helped us plan our day’s activity","50"
"BWK1955","What a completely delightful place. Truly delicious food prepared with integrity and passion, and really lovely welcoming people. Sadly not open at weekends so we only got to have one lunch here whilst in Copenhagen, but would have liked to eat lunch here every day if we could.","50"
"974bruced","Our first experience of Danish hospitality and it was perfect. A warm, friendly reception on a freezing cold day, sharing hot soup and a delicious sandwich in cosy surroundings, with useful tips for first time visitors to the city. Only regret: closed at the weekend so we couldn't go back!","50"
"maya11xo","Me and my friend went here for lunch! It’s hard to find a good quality tasty lunch spot in Copenhagen that doesn’t break the bank! Staff where friendly and helpful! They offered us a map and list of activities in the local area. Food was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced, if your staying in Copenhagen u must go here !!!","50"

"alexsX4067QP","Incredible food and drink, incredible friendly service. Will be one of the best lunches of your life","50"
"moniquezoi","We ate a soup and a sandwich and was suuuuuper good. They invited us to a shot of ginger bier, and then we take a cinamon cake, wow!  You must visit this place, the 2 guys are super nice and they explain everything.  The place is super small, only 4 tables, but enough to feel as at home ❤️. We will be back...","50"
"emanuelkarlsten","Its not often I give five stars, and the reason for this is not the food. Even though it was good, it was the details in this small cafes service. Its a small place, like ten seats, and they serve sandwhiches, salads and soups. But its how they do it. Friendly, serving by the table, a table that has phone chargers, bringing soap for your hands (""you'll be eating with your hands""), frosting the glass with ice cold water, and when exiting - they did put on their snow machine. Yes, you read it right. Snow machine. This was a wonderful experience in all its simplicity.","50"
"Chris N","At such an expensive place (Copenhagen) we were over the moon to find somewhere with such value for money and great staff. We only wish they were open weekends and we’d have went every day!","50"

"Lucy B","Really enjoyed 2 delicious sandwiches and a gorgeous hot chocolate. Took us a little while to find due to building work but definitely worth hunting down, convenient for both the station and tivoli gardens. Cosy place and such friendly staff. Will be retuning next time and already looking forward to it.","50"
"CatherineV1660","We went for lunch, just after we arrived at the Central Station from the airport. And what a nice first Danish experience! The two gentlemen who served us were very welcoming and helpful. We got to share a sandwich and a tomato soup and the food was divine. They even gave us a map and a paper with sites to visit. They offered us a little cleanser for our hands before eating our sandwiches. I totally recommend this place for a nice bite!","50"
"Shana P","We just happened to come across this amazing little restaurant as it was just a couple of blocks from the hotel we stayed at and what a great find! The owners are awesome, so friendly and even provided us with an “inspiration” sheet of suggestions of things to see & do in Copenhagen. The sandwiches were incredible - so fresh & delicious. Highly recommend the chicken/ mango/cashew sandwich - fantastic!","50"
"VictorvanderPols","Today we went for lunch at Grams. Based on the comments, we thought it would be worth the walk through the rain. And so it was. A cosy little sandwich shop, filled with people for both eating in and take away.  We were welcomed very friendly and found a place to sit.  On the house we got a gingerbeer shot, while we were waiting (4minutes only) for our orders: a ceasar salad and a chicken-mangochutney-cashewsandwich, accompanied by a raspberrysmoothie and a orange juice. All tasted very nice, and especially the sandwich brought back memories to Tuscany. We paid 180 DKK, money well spent on very well tasting food and a very pleasant service. We will be back here.","50"
"376jerryj","Fastastic food, drinks and great service. We received many free extras plus it’s super cosy. Thank you","50"
"MadeleineH513","We split tomato soup, chicken bacon avocado sandwich and Caesar salad. All served with fresh ingredients and delicious bread. Only about 12 seats inside but take away is available. Highly recommend if you want a fair priced, delicious lunch.","50"
"DaveyT4","This was our first lunch in Copenhagen, and we were prepared for a shock when paying for food, but this cosy lunch bar served excellent traditional Danish chicken & asparagus tarts, fantastic sandwiches and cracking coffee. The free ginger beer was a lovely touch and the staff were incredibly attentive. Would recommend!!","50"
