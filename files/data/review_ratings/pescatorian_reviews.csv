"271russelle","Clearly when in Copenhagen, like many cities, you must try and find somewhere to eat. The dilemma often is where. I always review on TripAdvisor and once again the ranking and comments were spot on.  Looking for a fish restaurants and the best Pescatarian came out as #1 and we were not disappointed.  Arriving slightly early we were greeted as all the chefs left the restaurant. But only to have their photo outside celebrating their nominations in the food awards for Copenhagen . We were surprised to learn they had only opened in January!  My wife and I enjoyed cocktails at the bar and a selection of nuts and I tried two local oysters - very good. We chose the 6 and 4 tasting fish menu with wines and enjoyed each one. My wife particularly enjoyed the very thinly sliced scallops and the Henry Fuchs Riesling and my choice was the langoustine bisque dish and the Arbois Chardonnay.  All round a most enjoyable meal with lively chefs who have a passion for their food and the restaurants success. Worth the cost.  We wish them every success in the Copenhagen food awards but more is there in terms of success in the future.","50"
"outi612018","The restarant has modern Scandinavian style interior. Service is friendly and relaxed, our waiter was quite a showman! We had special snacks and champagne first. The snacks were very interesting and delicious! They have set menu of 4 courses or 6 courses. Food is great and special credits for the dessert. It is a fine dining restaurant and a bit pricy, but worth of it!","50"
"MTDKIR90","We went to visit the newly opened Pescetarian, which was recommended by friends and online magazines. I must say it surpassed my expectations by miles. My partner went for the vegetarian option as she is not fund of fish normally, but even she loved what she tried of mine.  Perfect wine selections with the food, very friendly, open and professional staff. The waiters had great storytelling about each plate which was an experience itself, and the food was some of the best I've had.   I can only give my best recommendations for anyone curious to try The Pescetarian CPh, thanks for a good experience team!","50"

"DerrickJS","We celebrated our wedding anniversary at The Pescatarian and loved every minute of it. From a warm welcome through attentive service and skilled craftsmanship in the kitchen The Pescatarian should be regarded as the best restaurant in Copenhagen. They offer two styles of menu. One seafood (of course) and one vegetarian with both being offered in either a 6 course or 4 course format either with or without paired wines. We opted for the four course seafood with wine pairing. Whilst this is not a cheap restaurant, and I doubt anyone would expect it to be, it is still far less expensive than similar restaurants in London or Paris. Highly recommended.","50"

"minhn299","Creative , quality, sustainable at very affordable price. What can you ask for more! If you can’t get a table in Noma for 6 months or not prepared to pay for it. Then try Pescatarian when you are in Copenhagen. Located not far from Little Mermaid statue, Pescatarian offers a very friendly atmosphere with open kitchen. The food was stunning as described by many reviews. They had two main menu which is suitable for many preferences. We had our son with us, and they even tailor-made a dish for him. The staff are very well-trained and always with some sense of humor. We started off with the natural oyster which was so good that we ordered extra one. Then followed with 4 course menu with wine pairing. You will have a full description of the food and wines which was quite sophisticated I must say! Can’t wait to be back!","50"
"Line A","The Pescatarian is like their sister restaurant Marv and Ben excellent dining experience. Carefully composed dishes where texture and ingredients add to very tasty dishes in the tradition of the Nordic cuisine. After two visits I cannot choose if I prefers the seafood or Vegatarian menu. Both are great. Great value for money and warm hosting.","50"

"Tommy O","Attended a business dinner at The Pescatarian, and I must say that this was the best dinner ever. We had 8 small servings with some of the most tasteful and best presented food I have ever tasted. Simply amazing.  Service is top class, with a very professional yet informal approach on how to make you feel very welcome. And then an amazing wine list, with some great wines, which even for CPH standards can be difficult to find. All in all, a great experience - I will be back.","50"
"Gabriella O","We had an excellent dinner at The Pescatarian last night! Everything was perfect: the food, service and the atmosphere of the place.

"954trinea","I was so lucky to be there at the opening night, and wow what an experience. As we could not decide to go vegetarian of fish, we ordered both and shared among us. I'll do that again the next time i'll go there, there will be more next times!","50"
"D6078EIjohnh","We celebrated the birthday of my youngest son. Food was heavenly, the service fantastic, and all in all it made for an unforgettable evening. Second time I went that week to this awesome restaurant, which now is my favourite place to dine in Denmark","50"
"christianw400","Not enough words... went for dinner with my girlfriend and have to say that both food, wine, service and ambience was almost as good as the company. The food was exceptional and for someone mostly having fish as starter (and loving it) it was a true pleasure to have one fantastic dish after another utilizing a wide range of seafood. It is truly hard to say what stood out as everything was both beautifully presented and deliciously flavored. However, the Jerusalem artichoke dish (covered with truffle) was to die for and then the “æbleskiver” with caviar and truffle was another memorable moment! Well... we had nothing I would not recommend (see the pictures) The atmosphere and service was also spot on. One of those nights where you would love to stay for another glass of wine if you didn’t have to go to work the day after... I cannot wait to go back for a seafood platter and a glass of cold white this summer ","50"

The food was in a league of its own and I admire chefs who cook with their heart. They also found the most excellent wines to pair with the menu. We all loved that while it was top professional it was also laidback and had a warm atmosphere. Thank you The Pescatarian for showing us a new concept of hospitality. Absolutely worth a visit!","50"

"Amanda V","I went with a group of colleagues for dinner, and was impressed with the whole experience. The restaurant itself is beautiful--a great example of the famous Danish ""hygge""--with light blue walls, wooden tables, and lovely place settings. The service was also quite good; the staff were extremely knowledgeable about each of the products on the table, and gave extremely detailed descriptions of each dish. Our table tried both the vegetarian & pescatarian menus, which I would highly recommend, as there are dishes from each that I loved. The food is beautifully plated (Instagram-worthy), and tastes just as good. My favorite course was a tie between the modernized lobster bisque and the beet/smoked goat cheese foam, which were in the same course just before the main on each menu. Our server also recommend an excellent Chenin Blanc that was light, and like silk. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you have a special occasion, are a foodie, or want to do something nice for yourself.","50"
"VeroDenmark","We tried both the pescatarian and vegetarian menus... and couldn't decide which one was best! Each dish feels like a unique creation: pure delight for the eyes and absolutely delicious. If you are into fine cuisine, do not miss it.","50"
